tax declarations filed countries residence well moroccans residing abroad mothers worried several announce social networks among others several months already announce receiving letters banks fact seeing communication possible account undeclared banks moroccan authorities settle delicate file automatic exchange tax data member countries oecd
like many developing countries indeed morocco committed almost decade ago join system automatic exchange information held abroad thus joining multilateral convention mutual administrative system tax matters reason reason morocco join want join would direct indirect impacts application future law mothers
investments morocco also transfers moroccans around world prerequisites able apply law good due form talking evening guests pleasure welcoming set questions news colleagues mohamed zouar director publication yabiladicom site good evening good evening thank thank us answering questions also tax specialist us president circle tax specialists
morocco mohammedia good evening thank thank invitation thank accepting thank also answering questions joins us phone professor ahmed azura economist director research moroccan institute strategic intelligence limmis good evening thank invitation thank accepted perhaps start first current framework governs tax credits moroccans residing abroad let us already say plant
decor orientation little bit irreversible towards international compliance tax level legal level towards kind standardization started ten years ago morocco signed set conventions several lets say contribute direction transparency exchange information tax purposes fight money laundering lets say objective
least certain conventions entered force others protocols must put place also obligations modify internal law adapt precisely convention tax treaties superiority internal laws sometimes also push countries modify internal law general taxes example also seen morocco since adoption
tion law modification general tax code several years certain agreements yet come back life since would say certain aspects still things must also discussed adopted moroccan level lavoir particular two chambers ratification regard fact exchange information particular banking since subject must said already started particular implementation p
lace fadka united states already almost ten years exchange already operational already understand going going little bit thing standard kind reporting uniform required respect concern automatic exchange donationsborn countries going arrive approximately countries therefore signatories convention locde conceive
precisely implementation automatic data exchange standard yet entered force morocco certainly horizon would say year two foundations would say fact morocco asked like amnesty didnt really hear anymore came discussed parliament bill remember since
recalled history morocco ratified agreement cde said manic charge therefore head government deposited sense decree law enacts transitional provisions automatic exchange information purposes tax extent professor aziral enters within framework famous exit gray list also place also gafi linked much say colleague
evolution course comply done global scale morocco perspective therefore transparency normalization fight course illegal practices terms transfer funds terrorism cement broth etc various aspects interests us today really onerous aspect moroccans residing abroad first since requirement part say
ction foreign exchange office moroccans residing accounts abroad properties regularize situation therefore given friends styles years also question therefore standard reporting command therefore forum water transparency world cde agreement signed therefore ratified morocco course moroccan law must put law level international law
hasnt passed yet talking dont know thats thats leads today participate debate precisely large patriotic community mmos worried today anxious starts receive already said notifications also afraid receiving fines dying others others course problems
aut tell would naturally necessary today know exactly morocco communicate precise way heroes knows exactly happening horizon exchange information effective part morocco world question countries around world little ratified rope indeed makes good number countries therefore mothers precisely part category countries q
ui players also concerned giving banking property concerned press always specify actually seems effective application data exchange therefore applied years followed recently parliament precisely presence government circle made reassuring remarks sense saying nothing yet conventions
havent signed yet makes reassuring moment naturally necessary official things im specifying two elements governor front husband already alerted government months ago occasion interafrican meeting held morocco concerned way african countries receive transfers individuals rome far concerned
already difficulties blockages reported level banks level registers would really like us focus register transfers register transfer funds yetits always problem concerns therefore difficulties problem really dealt really want deal evening allow professor azura really question
tax yes concerns today mohammedia professor actually mentioned press lot ink spilled last year already controversy started swell heard indeed testimonies remains moroccan press already already started take action namely sell perhaps property held morocco actually two years ago
years early contacted yabiladi many moroccans foreign grapes worried since articles appeared press estimating agreement agreement ocde already recorded since january february march well swelled become explosive subject since millions compatriots live abroad large part live europe tax inspectors still edge uh
falling told since automatic exchange bank data well risk big problem time precisely done fact checkin job check elements since lot media particular online media even paper media morocco informed already acted mothers ran great tax risk tax adjustment asked life experts
c fact explained us already note dgi said nothing acted therefore need worry little bit professor saying say reassuring tone part dgi like reassuring tone today part government head government particular really desire create panic rather good thing therefore indeed asked
experts explained us important thing even convention yet force therefore yet automated system must careful since countries like france law law obligation taxpayer citizen tax household must declare bank account held abroad necessarily amount necessarily account number must declare whether
n account end box yes bank account abroad yes real estate today rather tense situation since law discussed relation agreement cda law discussed parliament perhaps come play months follow probably next years nothing done prepare compatriots abroad law
knowing long bank data exchanged automatically suddenly find odds tax situation since declared bank account upstream well end say gap tax adjustment addition also risks lovers fine see actually depend seriousness elements effectively
something harm necessary need part moroccan authorities good debate parliament also necessary inform general obligation declare account bank tax administration country residence like moroccan tax administration moroccan authorities visàvis moroccans give details
fact interests us notion tax residence thats nationality really nationality secondaryit tax residence exchange information tax purposes fact reciprocal directions begins first discussing moroccans moroccans hold financial assets financial assets abroad normally already prohibited already opened moroccans morocco precisely
ux recoveries analysts etc already view figures already seen surface relatively large already level already moroccans right open account abroad unless authorized foreign exchange office right invest like things already existed lets say less upgraded thats first level chances means would also necessary
rocains understand hold accounts abroad bah foreign banks start automatically communicate information moroccan tax authorities side concern time moroccans residing abroad mainly talking moroccans residents tax partner countries course talking specifically spain italy france holland belgium germany
nc especially diaspora starting pay must said tax declaration owe income world profits means everything earn dad take example meu tax resident france must course declare income france must also declare income abroad obligation already exists
must also said morocco already tax treaties also provide exchange information exchange request way already provided level tax treaties force several years exactly happening lets say moroccans residing abroad invest morocco real estate requested already avoid failure declare must already declared
r declare real estate necessary say small small question allow spoke fact obligation declare case french legislation declare bank account held abroad difference bank account held overseas declaring property property overseas thats theres really nuance thats im trying explain general way c
international conventions almost inspired western model real estate income profit untaxed good kind follow ground far securities concerned securities means income profile linked shares bonds social dividends would say income profits follow tax residence interests us specific case morocco
ins residing abroad hold accounts morocco first necessary avoid failure declare canton already underlined already declare accounts foreign tax administration holland france spain possibility going detail asking question relation accounts interest time countries interests
ts dividends capitalization accounts generates would say income profit values taxable country tax residence issue relatively important indeed understand little latitude speakers talking government also banks insurance companies etc even level set try invite tax administration
banks dont knowmaybe watchword communicate moment subject perhaps sensitive sulphurous subject given issue also talking would say chin sometimes drained annually morocco want make link precisely making link making link transfers talking flow say money transfers billions growth believe
last april extremely large amount billion already national gdp billion foreign currency precious economy finances country flow feed stock say today send dirhams per year bank account theorized well indeed make significant sum billions part goes family support part goes purchase
real estate land part remains theorized bank accounts flow indeed link going say organic flow money feeds bank account therefore probably several hundreds billions dirhams hoarded today banks part hundreds billions current accounts without remuneration therefore dividend interest hand
part accounts account books finally money invested stock market etc therefore obviously interest particular tax administrations countries example europe could interested dig much subject remind years ago netherlands even convention etc carried surveys real estate particular also property property bank accounts complete
ique since finally complicated cooperation system except ad hoc basis cases even hired finally took service police inspectors investigated come sly investigate real estate especially example moroccan dutchmoroccan rif entitled social assistance lowrental apartments therefore wanted check family likes
real estate morocco proof owned real estate morocco skipped social assistance perhaps even sometimes told getting lowcost housing apartment since right since already real estate abroad controversy also started weeks ago france case released argument relation
say amount transfers linked effectively one well held countries origin talk risks heme required declare would declare account abroad french tax authorities offense criminal lead years prison fine millions euros depends country also actually general tax codes country photo country convention
also talking several countries already spain germany france italy etc depends lets say general indeed lack declaration actually lead sanctions fines fact also noting dividends interests declared stake important give rise tax adjustments significant amount course penalties increase delay also
criminal risk would say law would say foresees country concerned talking multitude countries may concerned important attitude adopt morocco various managers fact continuing communicate good thing challengeds tax expert mothers lets say attitude seems
e entirely justified communicating much risk committing blunder awkwardness consequences development dgi let us remember really wind panic among community countries particularly european countries relation question clarification belgium said see moroccan minister taking floor explaining
ask clearly fear also consequences relation communicated subject sensitive opinion could put around table talking various officials talking ministry finance ministry foreign affairs tax administration also call number professional chartered accountants chartered accountants try think communication strategy would say ad
equate maybe even call communication professionals given sensitivity subject actually maybe fear see would say cause panic result account closures things kind given stake important recall minds transferred morocco coiti period period pandemic morocco needed funds counted
even fact volume would say transferred funds indeed hebrew must also accompany tax bridge must create think information cells time maybe maybe learned tax limitation periods also go back relation must think exchange information begins
someone failed declare someone declared effort pose problem cases pose problem also clarified someone transferred net product paying taxes etc invested morocco purchase city apartment generates rental income income taxable morocco problem cases
figure dont think several real estate rented generate rents yes directly civil real estate company fact cases find case moreover also investments form would say cycles term deposit accounts must said fact
often also produce obvious interest dividends etc cases tried would say study even simulations explanations popularize little bit matter fact even necessary leave like abandoned guests forums real estate products sell would say apartments villas plan etc needed
even communication needed etc dont need starting worry issue responding example concern also linked advantages social security also explained two separate things information exchanged information tax facts information communicated social organizations foreign social security funds therefore
rce also significant risk would say tax adjustment team also touch would say requests reimbursement compensation wrongly paid perhaps walls benefit advantage indemnitys question prevention information nature abhors vacuum allow wind panic set risk mothers simply close account try
transfer funds either via channels tell black market complicated informal little complicated repatriate currencies abroad case risk panicking must remembered two scenarios bank accounts real estate bank accounts transfer x euros year theorize account either spend holidays want
always sum event hard blow morocco money income normally talking people engaged illicit activity therefore already declare france belgium netherlands money comes declared income earn money declared son part money transferred declare bank account risk nothing risk nothing taxed
é second time risk compliance tax law country residence declare declare compliant initiative state also responsibility moroccan citizens inform plateau plateau inform risk nothing say inform bank account priori administration f
iscale tell long bank account declare two years ago years ago problem cases problem property complicated tax system also social achievements social rights belgium case netherlands talking moment also
case chibani france soon spent certain number months morocco moreover process even try restrict life level french parliament limit believe three months spent abroad well commonly called minimum old age say retirement supplement pension low since somewhat choppy career seasonal worked
go france month return morocco six months well habit spending six months habit longer right soon spend years ago well today longer four months six months depended either lapl minimum old age well try standardize therefore soon spend three months day morocco soon proof spend month day
one morocco repay overpayment cut old age minimum longer entitled quite large amounts followed cases shibani years years years repay euros longer right minimum old age therefore real estate morocco well entitled housing assistance example family allowances estimated property
monk enough pay charges children etc evict social housing social housing considered real estate property abroad say secondary house give right housing social see yet another problem things delicate compatriots abroad declare real estate assets morocco well actually
yes ever administration moment social affairs realize heritage make react perhaps professor us online precisely whatrisk happening application future law therefore already therefore tax administration receive status tax administration country residence receive possible information situation assets held country origin professor razeral e
case well indeed call plateau people quotation marks nothing reproach playing card transparency avoid impacts nondeclaration say today members european union home largest moroccan diaspora households concerned according facilitate making transitions little fluid accessible community moroccans residing
foreign especially europe two things first must forget rather special political context therefore european pressure general certain countries particular countries south mediterranean therefore africa morocco etc makes first point relation positive situations countries secondly problem requires asked precisely referring earlier governor national diplomatic winner
true therefore national religion subject question first importance transfer therefore important community morocco third element would also necessary clear communication strategy done regard including course official also representatives moroccan community particular famous moroccan council heroes
introduce debate reassure precisely today real anxiety anxiety explained effectively speakers well explained various aspects arise would like highlight one element economic advice social moroccan recently carried study transfers groupers quantified precisely transfers used locally
actually done almost used social reasons therefore family reasons say investments really insignificant compared transfers made morocco unlike certain countries even africa compared kenya etc whole reserve investment transfers really weak compared whole social therefore heroes explain lucky
u dont know come region known higher migrations northeast people today worried explain cases example number holds account know account small account general talking almost majority mr represents talk figures talking several hundred billion dirhams held viruses
represent roughly case third pardon deposits moroccan banks held mureux separate things banks details banks yes share us necessary concentrated dont know know overall really disparate majority cases small savers house bought house apartment
part family closed quite simply comes generally rural people must pirate therefore resides month time leaves secondly also people small account guard comes spend funerals things others really included true people concerned
problems still worried explain themthe end outcome must course national council precisely deal question eminently important content simply tell also told upgrade means people tell things going clarified going come rage sell n
houses going disaster us everyone one buy going brave precisely good saved lives case also account tell going sequence ever practically forced etc also fact forcing close accounts forcing declare nuance react wants
say indeed many already closed account must specified many already closed bank account morocco avoid official communication people know expect thats program also mainly inform money going going means etc believe people national interest also money
interesting also economy transfers large percentage balance payment absolutely clarify things even agree course everyone officially agrees transparency go well safe peace environment financed property also need foreign investment must done quickly possible
everyone course safeguard interests reassured also safeguarding national interests last round table president circle moroccan tax experts course consensus obligation first communicate necessary inform even especially start return operation started days ago beyond informative aspect prerequisites application
law effective application already important must already start level government level banks insurances think consequences lack communication likely happen continue attitude communication communicate communication technological device know also obvious also think protection
national tax base also try reverse threat little bit perhaps threat yes good strong threat talking threat risk talking dont know whats going happen imagine talking bank accounts moroccans living abroad least one bank account already youre talking lack declaration
ion account already poses problem meant speak reversing problem trying accompany advise people tax entrepreneurial plan plan try encourage invest one adequately also calling support professionals would necessary change little bit classic mode investment existed people anyway whether emerald
others need get speed given new situation terms international tax compliance cases classic cases relatively would say simple would say advisers quickly needed adequate way reassure also cases also would say slightly complex investments arrangements would say present ifalso killings exist
also may undeclared accounts declared funds correspond black way people need know would say main element training risks etc course done perhaps sensitivity etc necessarily requires involvement ministry
economy finance banks insurance companies even consulates abroad ministry foreign affairs really get started fear panic immediate future two three years many problems risk aggravation relation data targeted identity nonresident holders beneficiaries bank accounts
talking names course passport number contact details holder address account number account interest received really get finally ready ready date completely transparent also comes attention holder account moroccan state solve problem closure declared close account declared also ask question relation
history history prescription mentioned liable tax administration fact mediumterm risk entry force agreement cedea exchange automated data happens example said risk really says quotation marks nothing sure project etc time text law passes application decrees etc short necessary
e moroccan government moroccan authorities banking authorities waiting last minute last month tell mr listen declare change automated said yesterday indeed history prescription day go back another year general rule think years general companies current year case france
probably already four years old maybe countries even spread risk must actually start informing compatriots abroad especially nothing reproach illicit money money hidden tax office income declared well income bank account transferred part income azera says p
could thousand dirhams peanuts much even dirhams doesnt matter accordance previous tax returns everyone would come final indeed also another context medium term already today even already yesterday belgium netherlands also france maybe tomorrow spain italy going process tightening screws pa
believe indeed significant amounts therefore benefit social assistance social housing else pay enough taxes well going tighten screw squeeze lemon would say obtain either binationals either resides pay benefit much social assistance social housing rise right different european countries facilitate c
even less change future thank much president circle moroccan tax experts thank answered questions questions mothers indeed really enlightened public opinion duties also duties public authorities thank professor azzeralthank us phone today thank dear colleagues thank thank loyalty news question good self

hello everyone welcome economic emergency recent weeks world moved usual naval blockade imposed russia ukraine black sea risks causing nonvolley international wheat prices news concerning northern route promoted russia also china time today talk detail see extent likely impact world economy much market economy
ocaine pleased welcome sir madebroui hello hello thank accepted become regular economic emergency past happiness spectators another remind expert cpls chain want detail little bit career path auditors held logistics manager positions started bottom ladder started like tech
started team leader logistics progressed become logistics manager essentially automotive aeronautic environments last position industrialist lets say position manager responsible forecasting demand thats started take interest foresight forecasting macroeconomics inside market happening ends planet
impact business interested macroeconomic things ultimately actually go funnel end impacts business every day thats arrived subject entered world idiotseil since consultant various french companies essentially lets start naval blockade following attack use drone
naval ukraine would british manufacture even still debate bridge crimea russia decided withdraw grain agreement allowed cargo ship different countries different flags collect ukrainian wheat port design deliver across world today naval blockade threat destroy consider ship regardless flag hostile ship yes possibly transport
wines destined army ukraine yes starting talk risk global famine millions people would find nothing eat really talking get little fantasies im going leave initial hypothesis say following attack russians withdrew wheat agreement fact attack took place probably russians going withdraw agreement
wheat simple reason initial agreement russians authorized ukrainians sell wheat return westerners reintegrate russian agricultural bank swift system never refused never done respected brackets part contract therefore russians seriously threatened withdraw agreement point pancar
uis km therefore passable drone military experts say likely drone left grain ship precisely militarized blow make strike therefore becomes quite legitimate military thats russians saying grain ship considered military target drones come go hit sebastopol cash bridge
thats really rebuild things even russia long time complaining long time closed respected grain agreement altogether ended missing fact withdraw ready come back okay ever commitments western world thats first part withdraws deal respected bothered sell wheat
order countries able pay owe russia need swift system preventing russia selling freely without seeming care shortage wheat world care fact russians able also sell wheat given parentheses first producer therefore bad faith western discourse maintaining real weight ukraine since week
last ukraine one exclusive producer wheat world learn saying going starve ukraines longer sell wheat seriously appears season good several producing countries canada even china good good yields often forget among largest wheat producers world apart russia also since colin like china often forget
thinks west canada ah lot countries big wheat producer priori production fact subtracting ukraine world production obviously impact relatively tense walkers say people start starve street surely abused exaggerated canvass reacts level futures contracts wheat
spot market rise daytoday basis measure exactly reaction markets long term contracts rather fine absolutely spot market believeis increase day announcement things like quickly fell back things know panic level markets ukraine manage export wheat odessa french people succeed
russians broken everything nothing could perhaps bombed destroyed installations like discussions ship ventures black sea claiming deliver wheat immediately becomes allouche installation accommodate something else still send land romania poland
take boat except creates problems romans poles collapses wheat prices moreover unhappy sale cranial wheat european countries rivalries suddenly russians know best say blow failure prevent ukrainians main cash inflows left milk embarrass europeans v
think others well forced go land routes sell wheat seriously annoy neighbors fair game want say war kind attacks people hear certain african countries bought wheat ukraine even reality contrary official speeches majority ukrainian wheat exported go africa
early towards developed countries say hear russia tells us capable replacing ukrainian baby want promises want actions essential savings reintegration russian bank specialized agriculture swift system even currently means independently swift deliver paid otherwise russians always want always find soil
ution get paid one way poutine talked booklet quantities free afford russia country extremely rich contrary try make us believe country lives last century italian spanish gdp totally fallacious ways totally crazy devaluation totally wrong introduce purchasing power parity parity arrive netherlands
russia country rich moreover war started russians sitting billions surpluses lying around european american central banks many countries claim rich today claim thing country half placed abroad country rich stings something sell commodities world russia say
raw material almost russians produce sale big store remind despite war everything supply american nuclear power plants well buy enriched uranium russia everything today delivered uranium rosatum excluded absolutely sanction even europe unavoidable one reasons russians continue
see chips good already produced contrary say produce nanometers believe also monopoly rare gases make possible produce chips hold goatee long time see mean say russian going deliver chips tell going gas look like long time always finds holes always deals
say russia country rich means tooffer wheat offer well dont imagine offer production always find ways find ways hopefully hoping one way another simplest everyone cares family world allow russians sell wheat think food matters
must militarized etc another aspect morocco morocco intelligence recent years diversify sources wheat supply priori risk affected withdrawal ukraine world market wheat last year finally certain years super projection say morocco believe talking fires major producing countries canada
tc completely believe production morocco speak resin less good yield good structurally since already cover barely little less half must ferréal widely forgiveness wheat yes year good particularly good good last year believe morocco concluded deal india made embargo sales wheat
é outside except morocco made exception morocco maybe others know made exception morocco certainly phosphate deal year dont know whats going like like deal real problem still normal country like morocco ambitions morocco still able solve problem food selfsufficiency russia
sanctions beginning years net importers food since sanctions become net exporters even wheat worlds leading one today satisfied seeming real find solutions especially since lack land lack real intelligent modernization targeted accompanied sector indeed force agricultural producer make alo wheat
rs profitable compared yields competing countries girland russia china problem problem needs interesting profitability able compete problem subsidies poses problem problem profitability know europeans americans subsidies culture makes quintal wheat produced depths france cheaper wheat
produced depths morocco competitive european american experience side absolutely therefore subsidies distort market little said question strategic question existential subsidized also want say means consider strategies accept wipe loss
first point second point also certain moment copernican revolution food uses wheat best cereal country like morocco terror looking sorghum thousand much less water consuming wheat mainly brought westerners continue grow corn country even though
plant southern hemisphere fact full bloom middle summer consumes lot water nothing least also questions must ask necessarily requires work public authorities must intervene also agricultural techniques im sorry still techniques school dates dates french whatsay departure
modernized look yields per quintal morocco yield per quintal europe especially france know well practically half strategic people integrate profitability dimension food dimension aiming strategic talking northern route everyone talking new silk road etc northern route make possible bypass
iterate little oceans objects angloamerican hegemony etc northern route intended say broker american navy controls controls seas world controls straits want send goods example since going talk oil leaves persian gulf arrive china obliged cross strait malacca strait malaka time americans therefore import
time finally also passes south india therefore chinese little much indians indians cut tap order hostage chinese energy supply absolutely chinese anything ability project far contrary american myths chinese navy navy navy mothers littoral defensive littoral navy
socalled blue water navy deployable navy high seas aircraft carrier bought russia dates soviet era modernizing hey moving hegemony aircraft carrier advent hypersonic missiles laptops become obsolete sunk missile people record death aircraft carriers already outdated
fragility visàvis india fragility visàvis americans controlled malacca rights find alternative thats created silk roads say america maritime power much less terrestrial suddenly passing lands little less bothered americans fact understood russians arrived concepts route north say today route
e north north pole russian people actually north fact essential deposits yamal today talking yamal go along russian coast land land chinese gates shanghai advantage route third cheaper finally saint petersburg go northern route arrive shanghai third shorter completely expensive go saintp
etersburg baltic mediterranean real economic interest continue say economic interest road like transport oil gas things transported better cheaper via gas pipelines course takes time produce manufacture put place waiting road alternative chinese advantage journey goes others
russian territorial case silk road passes different countries may object already instabilities finally seen burma compared southern route kazakhstan seen revolts year half ago think two years ago lets say reliable continue hotels quite lot insolation country rather going country doorman wear behind thierry
simple guns russians cause lot problems god knows russians guns first remove guns world put perfectly ready protect road road chinese go video stock chinese hotels theset perfectly defensible far seeing americans always try blow already
complicated make nuclear ice embers necessarily im talking americans quite dont brigades thought submarine drag submarine damage want thats like street exploded divers accused trawler sailors thats blew firecracker bought area
american day job ah yes controversial conspiracy theorists agree becomes terrorist absolutely thats careers made quickly road north thats essentially today interest interest also chinese isaac chinese ensure supply hydrocarbons today chinese largest raw materials store world street built g
az ouducs even continue northern route continue transport ore bad oil whole quantity ores everything needed china priori problem neither access cheap energy raw materials already case since two hydrocarbon markets global scale market preferential prices reads russia india china buys depth
oi rest world buys market price yes dollars already differential benefits terms competitiveness chinese indian economy completely long term contracts yes learned yesterday day think thats prices russian crude exceeded ceiling set europeans need chinese making big stimulus plans economy
chinese accounts subsidies restarting pull market obviously tense known cost production russian oil dollars two countries lowest cost production per barrel world russians saudis dollars cost production even cap dollars average indeed certain regions russia cost dollars others less expensive
average dollars say reference russian crude budget dollars dollars everything goes receipts absolutely sell still still making lot money witnessing say fact split world lasie india bloc china access cheap cheap energy almost unlimited almost unlimited idea ten
due russian reserves even dont know russian oil dug anyhow time stalin still work done side terrain vast side europe europe united states united states sitting reserve least years come question moment danon farce europe europeans cut cheap energy nuc alternatives
léaire longer nuclear power teach others lesson consumes coal south africa real scandal doesnt matter europe longer access energy expensive time costs works expensive world economic equation europe starting become complicated scheme morocco take advantage presenting credit alternative
ible particular thinking nigeria atlantic chart runs along entire west african coast crosses moroccan territory sarah moroccan would make possible deliver gasified gas throw away gml yes europeansns find good initiative hasten invest move project forward far see particular movement least nothing announce know european side
strange trying make sure algeria deliver little gas algeria already decline reserves time one countries highest population growth continent practically million algerians per year demographic band contrary demographic transition schemes quantity goes back completely moreover partly lost credibility
arm wrestling started spain made difficult sell language afterwards turned unreliable partner capable taking hostage energy delivery today choice forced deal choice problem algerians less less gas sell real problem soon little production consume
r internal market precisely demographic growth need energy well buddies europeans offered somewhat strange market telling help make sun consume solar energy us gas know better dont know algerians accepted contract hey dont know anything alternative
nt algeria libya moment really draw resources problems experiencing libya mediterranean quite greece still gasomics pass turkey yes ukrainians elsewhere trying sabotage beauty situation still tense indeed europe would try ensure nigeria morocco gas pipeline moves forward moves forward quickly nothing
europeans solve energy problems able put place next years fact complicated paths moment talk know maybe think know think qatari emirati minister said day soon europeans going become friends russians basically choice want energy time
done unless united states may planned decides recover german industry telling bah embarrassment expensive couple came children already go time famous patriotact patriotism cant remember name law word patriot means grant subsidies electric vehicles produced american soil thats forcing actors
electric vehicles relocate locate trump believe also make foot calls many german industrialists longer operate energy costs today europe strange thing find strange france first country benefit france continues produce electricity relatively cheap thanks nuclear power plant gradually losing
aged investment even closed would like see ecological problem tackled head power station closed may everything need would able dump saying kilowatt hour cheaper home cross kidney also also german immigration process done towards spain portugal
spain portugal outside european market spain big hydrocarbon hub long time countrywhich degradation facilities needed therefore also see certain migration towards spain okay even spain problem everywhere else tension human resources therefore effectively americans stripping europe industrial gems
dont know europeans going settle wont necessarily see started bricks presented credible alternative collective antioxidant say including european market much structures go even queue lot countries want join goes mexico algeria even wanted buy ticket thought tickets sale
ndre think credible alternative heterogeneity depends making bricks today kind economic union club economic club fact started bit like want defend interests little visàvis collective west tries everything countries replace head global economic food ladder today bank investment bank b
risks today bank paper promising fact finances projects done inside countries brix perhaps want return people countries anyone imf bad reputation organization sinks countries helps try find alternatives finance without necessarily break everything may reason
country try enter form access funding ideologized thats give lessons without interference gives give lesson also side bricks escape control united states lot things starting today make move swift cia right away traces exchanges necessarily go dollar like united states
nt annoying tendency recent years project rights dollar used extraterritoriality american law quite moment dollar used always risk finding conflict american justice time conflict american justice dont look long find loser general absolutely lets talk dollar talking alternating
tive credible happening level people talk dollarization started bricks true exaggerated surely true yes fact put things place two parts economic part military component may say economic component fact countries longer wish use dollars reasons mentioned therefore excerpt american law fact longer want danons
joke may say say longer wants financier american deficit americans print money make deficit premium dollar everyone needs dollars everyone buys money fact buying money taking money return deficit finance deficit therefore regime also finance also bah imperial power able print infinity finance effect
want rejuvenate joins military part discussion russians chinese also trying prevent americans able print ad infinitum finance military budget colossal information viewers american budget military greater sum military budgets whole earth finance real money couldnt country would collapse p
economy notur would finance budget think chinese americans trying bring back concrete ensuring united states begins bear consequences money printing supported today others support plan go share inflation us completely whole planet yes pools mutual deficits
want chinese russians two things break link dollar energy yes oil dollar calls question value dollar currency necessary everyone back gradually currencies gold compared longer print infinitely decline automatically degrade value currency therefore choice two currencies one
value face value paper printed equivalent north naturally choice made take one based gold guaranteed thats two two things russians chinese trying via bricks regard dollar contrary hear often seek replace dollar currency exchange
universal say could quantity today art liquid asset world harmony monetary mass dollars colossal move billions dollars second price dollar move dont currency see right away wont replaced right away trying bring american power back real level
managed economy like like reasonable state true means fictitious printing dollar therefore point view understand correctly fact china want profoundly cause collapse united states economy american dollars dollars dollars world want lose billions believe dollars form reserves front treasury therefore china wants rather multi member
tipolar contract little american hegemony bring back primordial first power power actually want going say thing differently want competition oneself best wins okay hello monopoly dont play bank thats bank takes note thats americans dont want go dont means confron
ter two economies facing would means chinese well problems particular demographic serious demographic problem surely overcome must find way legacy decades totally crazy policy completely pays price today look didnt believe long announced chinese starting approach ban microprocessors

must see something eliminate competition know today morocco terms electricity example producing renewable electricity produce less expensively producing carbon electricity signed medium voltage advantages much competitive today course advantages quantified according consumption thats technical
quite complicated cheaper significantly less expensive second things system also logistical part proximity morocco ensure even advantageous compared traditional competition believe see system relation moroccos positioning relation qualities also relation longstanding commitment without ulterior motive develop leadership impulse

takes peak lowest price last three next lowest give idea happen still phase high prices still begin descent move towards therefore perhaps would even legalize deposits investments one country invested discovery new deposits also invested
exploitation new deposits country world russians also reason somewhere conflict enters ukraine russia defined question remains part war currently share take cake goes billions dollars order able biggest slice cake must complete energy mastery question conflict ukraine russia
ssie two options either lucrin finally wins skull weather weather west wins time indeed good days ahead hand russians win thermal thermal often see november planet moreover already see globally two economic blocks case yet geopolitical constituted could integrated energy reading since bricks remain attacked

tax base factor excellent moroccan economy well known part panel point ask question said listen like religion five pillars increase plate become well industrialized fast lot pillars two mandatory energy research development told research level development
leave aside lets talk energy gave example worlds leading exporter sardines tons sardines per year know value chain often hear industrial value chain chain value control even take canned fish canned sardines sardines course etc canned aluminum sheet aluminum entrepreneurs
moroccans stupid open knowing unfortunately open factory manufacture canned sardines manufacturing process console factory cooks united states western europe eastern europe china manufacturing process bath therefore aluminum price stock market add transformation added value level rules game filming even
dont know countries unfortunately preserve made morocco knife expensive made eastern europe expensive western europe say spot transpoint simple industrial process energy plays role especially genius manufacturing process exceeds cost price energy becomes vital element competitiveness

wins would gas renewables longer use elements un put place among renewable energy well un level prohibited banks lending investment exploitation fossil fuels right lend renewable investments today ecological discourse ratings given whole
marketing countries know personally talk gironoubles told west five lets say one fossil figure means longer worth exploiting look really clash titans levels basely primary fire remains energy way somewhere west case united states losing fossil energy fall back

dollars made x x yes precisely refineries closed covid particular therefore energy sovereignty passes among things ability refine product oneself crude oil anyone rather import derivatives foreign exchange reserves must strategically restructured forwardlooking logic redeployment alternative markets reduce share
dependence european union recession already experiencing worsen apart major axes others morocco terms example talk merchant fleet greece finally countries like chile etc morocco terms capacities terms weak logistics morocco today fleet whether merchant military largely undersized relation geographical position
e ambitions today morocco said military buildings capable taking high seas say talking availability know building availability rate training needs lots lots things happen military building regardless type means ten roughly projectable ones time extremely low
morocco would morocco already talking outside morocco inside morocco people exploit little littlewater want send goods tangier casablanca send via highway via truck ultra limit whereas used water knowing maritime transport costs tenth road transport costs quantity transport huge ecofriendly containers
romans knew coming time romans romans morocco used sea rivers case rivers smooth river thats little road brings back morocco romans used water available morocco sailed rather building roads think thats good attitude resume okay sovereignty economy
also fact acquiring cheap means justice available even terms capacity move goods already inside morocco even talking exchanging rest world already inside morocco projecting merchant navy military ensure trade routes mainly towards africa possibly towards mediterranean especially towards africa question cost road
ier costs much maritime say years awareness logic good level railways sgv high speed line tgv people goods maritime level still big project jemed strategically located mediterranean atlantic allowing play
tables end make morocco also platform world trade etc currently talking future project darla huge port dakhla connect rest atlantic saying infrastructure good enough also need projection capacity military commercial one protects yes expensive course enormously expensive especially everything
maritime training people equipment enormously expensive know aviation expensive naval air force buildings take years build fact talk maritime today next whats going happen years say costs even expensive course americans withdrawing security increases
ity security military roads finally commercial roads benoît malon therefore like change two ways approaching either participate wish quietly back wall wrong last question medium long term rather project chinese new silk road aimed circumvent american gemmonies oceanic level father depth
continental eurasian china globally sovereign countries rather close like kazakhstan russia etc reach northern europe morocco joined slope maritime version silk road partnership signed would materialization project make possible solve problem reduce costs putting land sea competition way roads
ie mainly chinese project products import im looking back europe know lot countries positive trade balance china apart germany germany think thats longer case case trade obviously attract chinese capital time complicated agree relation europe russians indeed
complicated madnessand could worked say merchandise one side ideas capital could finally paper works yet seen real physical manifestation finally general trade chinese often favor chinese fact always like otherwise last alternative still paper polar route proposed russia yes nuclear icebreakers
areas allow access directly yes favoring factor according wish wish even forgiveness nuclear ice flanges warming make way course excredible alternative end russian communication already northern road talking road going open parenthesis explain russians imperative need
end road oil extracted si bf supplies port saint petersburg therefore therefore flows towards europe comes siberia side oil comes permafrost therefore russians need oil constantly flowing stops flowing freezes freezes everything dedicated thats bit reason europeans trying annoy ensure blocks export p
short story soviet union collapsed could longer export oil saudi arabia doubled production whole network whole extraction network collapsed brought knees soviet union ended collapsing russians trying find solutions oil continues come small parts say solutions use
e punctually stop later economic interest pipelines go siberia chemicals process building use railway contract billions dollars two signed particular supply china energy therefore process routing pipelines siberia fields siberia china put even good chinese
extraordinary work force chinese take years years dont know tend go paths oil stops flowing one solutions go around also speaks railway pass iran go india supply one oils things done require lot time paths maritime routes today
