madam sir good evening Moroccans living abroad in turmoil because of this future law on the exchange of financial information between Morocco and the OECD countries years after its submission to parliament this bill which therefore concerns the automatic exchange of information relating to accounts financial was discussed by our parliamentarians it was the first July since the entry into force of the obligation to declare bank accounts held in Morocco in
 tax declarations filed in the countries of residence and well the Moroccans residing abroad the mothers are worried several of them announce the social networks among others and this for several months already they announce receiving letters from their banks on the fact of seeing communication of possible account undeclared banks how will the Moroccan authorities settle this delicate file of the automatic exchange of tax data with the member countries of the OECD
like many developing countries and indeed Morocco it was committed almost a decade ago now to join the system of automatic exchange of information on having held them abroad by thus joining the multilateral convention on the mutual administrative system in tax matters for which reason and for what reason did morocco join did it want to join this what would be the direct and indirect impacts of the application of this future law on their mothers
 investments in Morocco but also on the transfers of Moroccans around the world what are the prerequisites for being able to apply this law in good and due form we are talking about it this evening with my guests I have the pleasure of welcoming on the set of questions of news colleagues mohamed zouar director of publication of the yabiladicom site good evening good evening thank you thank you for being with us and answering questions and we also have a tax specialist with us he is president of the circle of tax specialists
 from morocco mohammedia good evening thank you thank you for the invitation thank you for accepting it and thank you for also answering our questions joins us by phone professor ahmed azura economist director of research at the moroccan institute of strategic intelligence limmis good evening thank you for the invitation thank you for having it accepted then I will perhaps start with you first what is the current framework which governs the tax credits of Moroccans residing abroad let us already say to plant
 the decor that we are in an orientation which is a little bit irreversible which is that in the most towards international compliance on the tax level on the legal level towards a kind of standardization this started ten years ago Morocco signed a set of conventions there are several but let's say that they all contribute in the same direction more transparency exchange of information for tax purposes fight against money laundering let's say that the objective is more o
at least the same there are certain conventions which have entered into force others not there are some in which there are protocols which must be put in place with also obligations to modify the internal law to adapt it precisely to the convention because tax treaties have a superiority over internal laws and sometimes we also push countries to modify their internal law such as general taxes for example  we have also seen it in Morocco since there has been adoption
tion of law modification of the general tax code over several years and certain agreements have not yet come back to life since I would say on certain aspects there are still things that must also be discussed and adopted at the Moroccan level by the lavoir in particular of the two chambers for the ratification here with regard in fact to the exchange of information in particular banking since it is the subject it must be said that it has already started with in particular the implementation of p
the lace of the fadka with with the united states it was already in so there it's almost ten years this exchange is already operational already so just to understand what it's going to be about it's going to be a little bit the same thing now we have a standard it's a kind of reporting which is uniform so we are required to respect and which will concern the automatic exchange of donationsborn between between the countries there we are going to arrive approximately countries therefore signatories of this convention of locde and which will be conceive
precisely by the implementation of this automatic data exchange standard which has not yet entered into force in Morocco but which will certainly be in a horizon I would say of a year or two of the foundations of I would say of in fact it is Morocco had asked for it to be what is like an amnesty until we didn't really hear about it anymore it came out because it was discussed in parliament because there is this bill we should just remember since you
You recalled the history that Morocco had ratified this agreement with the cde in it was said the other manic was in charge therefore head of the government and who had deposited in this sense the decree of law which enacts the transitional provisions for the automatic exchange of information for purposes tax to what extent professor aziral this enters within the framework of this famous exit from the gray list also of place and also of of the gafi is linked so how much to say the colleague so
 it is an evolution of course to comply with what is done on a global scale and Morocco and in this perspective therefore of transparency of normalization of fight of course against illegal practices in terms of transfer of funds when terrorism against cement broth etc. so there are various aspects but what interests us today is the really onerous aspect so Moroccans residing abroad first there has been since then this requirement on the part of the say
ction of the foreign exchange office of Moroccans residing here and who have accounts abroad or properties to regularize their situation had therefore given them friends styles of years but now there is also this question therefore of this standard reporting command therefore of this forum water transparency world cde which is an agreement which was signed therefore ratified by Morocco in but of course there is this Moroccan law which must put our law on a level with international law
which hasn't passed yet so we're talking about I don't know if that's so that's what leads me today to participate in this debate is that precisely the large and patriotic community of our mmos are worried today they are very anxious because it starts to receive for some already when you said so notifications and then also they are afraid of receiving fines dying if not others others of course other problems then what is it?
aut to do so this is where I tell you it would naturally be necessary today that we know exactly that morocco can communicate in a precise way with our heroes so that he knows exactly what is happening on what horizon so this exchange of information will be effective on the part of morocco with the world it is a question of countries around the world a little more than we have ratified the rope so indeed that makes a good number of countries here is therefore the mothers are precisely part of the category of countries q
ui are players who are also concerned so giving them banking their property is concerned so after the press I always specify so because there is not it actually seems that the effective application of this data exchange will therefore be applied in a few years so I followed recently in parliament  precisely in the presence of the government circle  we have made reassuring remarks in this sense  saying that there is nothing yet and that the conventions are not
haven't signed yet so what makes it reassuring for the moment but it is naturally necessary that official things can be I'm just specifying two elements because the governor in front of the husband had already alerted the government to me a few months ago on occasion of an inter-African meeting which was held in Morocco we are concerned in the same way as the other African countries which receive transfers from individuals from Rome so as far as we are concerned
and already difficulties and blockages are reported at the level of the banks at the level of the registers I would really like us to focus this is on the register of transfers this is on the register of transfer of funds we are not there yetit's always the same the same problem that concerns and therefore there are difficulties which are the problem which really dealt with and which we really want to deal with this evening if you allow it professor azura it's really this question
 tax so yes there are concerns today mohammedia professor actually mentioned the press there was a lot of ink that spilled it was last year it was already in in the controversy started to swell we heard about there were indeed testimonies remains on the Moroccan press why is it already and have some of them already started to take action  namely to sell perhaps their property held here in Morocco actually more than two years ago
  years early we were contacted on yabiladi by many moroccans of foreign grapes who were worried since articles had appeared in the press estimating that this agreement this agreement with ocde has already been recorded since january so in february march and well it swelled it has become an explosive subject since we have about millions of our compatriots who live abroad a large part of them live in europe with tax inspectors who are still on edge uh who can
falling on them and so they are told what are we doing since if an automatic exchange of bank data well we risk having a big problem then we at the time had precisely done a fact checkin job to check all these elements since a lot of media in particular online media and even paper media in Morocco had informed that it was already acted and that the mothers ran a great tax risk of tax adjustment we had asked for the life of experts and
c and in fact they explained to us that then already there was a note from the dgi which said that nothing had been acted and therefore there is no need to worry this is a little bit what the professor was saying  that is to say that there had a reassuring tone on the part of the dgi like the reassuring tone today on the part of the government of the head of government in particular so there is really this desire not to create panic so it is rather a good thing and therefore we have indeed asked to
 experts who explained to us a very important thing is that even if the convention is not yet in force and therefore there is not yet this automated system  we must be very careful since countries like France have in their law in the law the obligation for each taxpayer each citizen each tax household must declare any bank account held abroad not necessarily the amount not necessarily the account number but must declare whether or not he has a
n account end so at the box yes I have a bank account abroad yes I have real estate so today we are in a rather tense situation since there is a law which is discussed in relation to this agreement with the cda a law which is discussed in parliament  perhaps it will not come into play in the months that follow  probably in the next few years  but nothing is being done to prepare our compatriots abroad for this law
 knowing that as long as the bank data will be exchanged automatically they will suddenly find themselves at odds with their tax situation since if they have not declared this bank account upstream and well they will end up with a how to say a gap so which then for once it is both a tax adjustment but in addition it also risks lovers a fine or see here after all will actually depend on the seriousness of the elements but effectively
  it is something that can harm them so it is necessary and there we need on the part of the Moroccan authorities it is good that there is a debate in parliament but it is also necessary to inform on then in general that they have the obligation to declare their account in bank to their then tax administration in the country of residence as they did like the Moroccan tax administration where the Moroccan authorities did visàvis Moroccans here to give more details
 in fact what interests us here is the notion of tax residence that's it it's not nationality really nationality is secondaryit is the tax residence this exchange of information for tax purposes in fact it is reciprocal it is in both directions begins by first discussing the Moroccans the Moroccans who hold financial assets and financial assets abroad normally already it is prohibited but we have already opened moroccans in morocco but there have been precisely
ux recoveries of analysts etc already in view of the figures already so we have seen that the surface is relatively large so here we are already at this level there already Moroccans do not have the right to open an account abroad unless authorized by the foreign exchange office not the right to invest like that so it's very but it's things that already existed let's say that have been more or less upgraded that's the first level of chances that means that now it would also be necessary for my
rocains understand that those who hold accounts abroad bah foreign banks so now will start to automatically communicate this information to the Moroccan tax authorities now on the other side it will concern this time Moroccans residing abroad I am mainly talking about Moroccans who are residents tax in the partner countries so here of course we are talking specifically about spain italy france holland belgium germany do
nc especially this is where you have most of this diaspora who are starting to pay it must be said that for a while now when you do your tax declaration you owe all of your income and your world profits that means everything you earn dad if i take the example of a meu who is a tax resident in france so he must of course declare his income in france but he must also declare his income who he has abroad it is an obligation that already exists there
 it must also be said that Morocco already has tax treaties which also provide for an exchange of information but it is an exchange on request in a way but it is already provided for at the level of tax treaties which have been in force for several years now what exactly is happening let's say that most of these Moroccans residing abroad invest here in Morocco in real estate now what is requested is already to avoid the failure to declare it must already be declared
r declare your real estate you own here it is necessary to say a small which is a small question if you allow it because spoke of the fact of the obligation to declare in any case for the French legislation to declare a bank account held abroad that is what is the difference between a bank account held overseas and declaring a property a property overseas that's where there's really a nuance that's what I'm trying to explain in a general way in the c
international conventions that are almost all inspired by the western model real estate income their profit untaxed where it's good to be so they kind of follow the ground as far as securities are concerned securities that means all that is income profile linked to shares bonds by social dividends there I would say it is income these profits follow tax residence so now what interests us in this specific case Morocco
ins residing abroad who hold accounts here in Morocco there is first of all it is necessary to avoid the failure to declare the canton itself already as it has just been underlined already you declare do you have accounts or not then the foreign tax administration that can be the Holland France Spain and the possibility of going into more detail you are asking the question in relation to these accounts there because what will be of interest at this time these countries are the interests
ts the dividends the capitalization accounts what generates I would say as income as profit because these are values ​​which are taxable in the country of tax residence and there that the issue it can be it can be relatively important and indeed we do not understand not a little latitude of the speakers so I am talking about the government but also the banks  insurance companies  etc. because even at the level of your set if you try to invite the tax administration or
 banks i don't knowmaybe there is a watchword not to communicate for the moment the subject is perhaps sensitive sulphurous subject given the issue we are also talking about I would say the chin sometimes which are drained annually in Morocco why we do and we do not want to make the link precisely why are we making the link why are we making the link between transfers of the same we are talking about a flow that is to say money transfers are billions in with growth I believe more and more
last April so we are we are on an extremely large amount billion we are already on national GDP billion in foreign currency it is very precious for the economy and the finances of the country it is the flow but which will feed a stock that is to say today if you send dirhams per year on your bank account if it is theorized and well after a while indeed it can make a significant sum so it is billions then a part goes to family support a part goes to the purchase of
 real estate or land a part remains theorized on the bank accounts so this flow indeed there is a link I was going to say organic you have a flow of money which feeds the bank account and therefore very probably we have several hundreds of billions of dirhams which are hoarded today in the banks then part of these hundreds of billions are on current accounts without remuneration therefore there is no dividend where there is no interest but on the other hand a
not part can be accounts on account books finally money invested in the stock market etc and therefore there is obviously an interest of any particular of the tax administrations of the countries for example in europe which could be interested in it and dig much more the subject and I remind you that a few years ago the Netherlands even before this convention etc. we carried out surveys on real estate in particular but also on property then property bank accounts it was more complete
ique since there was no finally it was more complicated there was no cooperation system except on an ad hoc basis on a few cases but they have they had even hired finally took the service of police inspectors who had investigated who had come on the sly to investigate real estate  especially for example in the Moroccan or Dutch-Moroccan rif who were entitled to social assistance for low-rental apartments and therefore wanted to check that each family likes
 did not own real estate in Morocco and when they had proof that he owned real estate in Morocco he skipped social assistance and perhaps even sometimes told them that you were getting out of this low-cost housing apartment since you did not have any the right since you already have real estate abroad it is a controversy which also started a few weeks ago in france in any case we had released this argument there in relation to these
that is to say the amount of the transfers and they have linked to this effectively one or well held in the countries of origin but all the same when we talk about what risks the heme required do not declare who would not declare their account abroad to the French tax authorities it is an offense criminal it can lead to up to years in prison and a fine of millions of euros it depends on the country also because you actually have general tax codes for each country in the photo each country in the convention has
also here we are talking about several countries already spain germany france italy etc so it all depends but let's say that in general indeed the lack of declaration can actually lead to sanctions fines the fact also of noting that there are dividends of interests which are not not declared that the stake is important there too it can give rise to tax adjustments which can be of significant amount with of course the penalties the increase of delay with also
if a criminal risk when I would say the law I would say foresees it for the country which is concerned because here we are talking about a multitude of countries which may be concerned now what is important for me is what is the attitude to adopt here in Morocco by the various managers is the fact of continuing not to communicate on is it a good thing are you being challengeds as a tax expert by mothers but let's say there is an attitude that seems to me
e not entirely justified which is that of not communicating too much at the risk of committing a blunder or an awkwardness which can have consequences on the development of the dgi all the same let us remember it because there had really been a wind of panic among the re community in all countries  particularly European countries  in relation to this question and there was this clarification it was Belgium who said this is what it is I can not see a Moroccan minister taking the floor and explaining
ask clearly what it is about for fear also of the consequences in relation to what will be communicated so the subject is sensitive but in my opinion it could be put around a table I am talking about the various officials I am talking about the Ministry of Finance the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the tax administration also call on the same number professional during chartered accountants during chartered accountants try to think about a communication strategy I would say the most ad
equate maybe even call on communication professionals given the sensitivity of the subject because actually maybe the fear is to see I would say or to cause a panic which can result in account closures by things of this kind there and given the stake which is very important I just recall all these minds which were transferred to Morocco during the coiti period so it is a period of pandemic or Morocco needed funds and we counted
t even in fact on this volume I would say transferred funds and indeed now it is Hebrew we must also accompany them on the tax bridge we must create I think information cells is it the time or not when is it maybe that maybe that it is now they have not learned because there too tax limitation periods because we can also go back in relation to so we must not think that if the exchange of information begins
it's someone who is who is who has failed to declare someone who has who has not declared effort all that can that can pose a problem and then there are cases that do not pose a problem they should also be clarified someone who has transferred a net product after paying his taxes etc and he invested in Morocco in the purchase of a city in the apartment which generates rental income for him this is income he is he is taxable in Morocco so there is no problem so all these cases of
Figure I don't think there are several so do you have real estate is it rented or not does it generate rents yes do you own it directly through a civil real estate company it is in fact cases that we will find who there is no case and then moreover you can also have investments here in the form of I would say in cycles in in term deposit accounts because it must be said that it is when in fact s
often they also produce obvious interest or dividends etc. so these cases should be tried to I would say to study them with even simulations of explanations to popularize a little bit it is this matter because in fact it is not even necessary leave them like that abandoned what is just the guests through forums where you have real estate products you sell I would say apartments and villas off plan etc so it is not just that what is needed or
 even communication is needed  etc. they don't just need that  so there they are starting to worry about the issue of responding  for example  concern also linked to the advantages that have through social security  they should also be explained to them that these are two separate things. the information that will be exchanged is information on tax facts and it is information that will not be communicated to social organizations to foreign social security funds  therefore not
rce there can also be a significant risk of I would say not only tax adjustment but the team can also touch I would say requests for reimbursement of compensation wrongly paid to perhaps walls that should not benefit from this or that advantage or indemnitys on the question of prevention and information nature abhors a vacuum if we allow a wind of panic to set in the risk is that mothers will simply close their account and try
to transfer the funds either via the channels how to tell the black market so that it is complicated informal because it is a little complicated to repatriate currencies abroad but in any case there is a risk of panicking and doing it which must be remembered then there is has two scenarios bank accounts and real estate then bank accounts when you transfer x euros each year and you theorize it on your account either to spend the holidays or because you want
always have a sum in the event of a hard blow or other in Morocco this money it has is your income normally I am not talking about people who are engaged in illicit activity and who therefore do not already declare in France or Belgium or the Netherlands it is this money here it comes from your declared income so you earn money you declared it to the son part of this money you transferred it you declare this bank account you risk nothing you risk nothing you will not be taxed
é a second time so there is no risk on this and you and you will be in compliance with the tax law of your country of residence but you have to declare it but you have to declare it to be compliant with the initiative to do it and not to be of the state it is also the responsibility of these Moroccan citizens to inform them on this plateau from this plateau to inform them that there they risk nothing  that is to say they will inform that they have a bank account a priori the administration f
iscale will not tell them how long you have had this bank account so why did you not declare it two years ago years ago there should be no problem so in most cases there is no problem now the property it's more complicated because there is not only the tax system there are also all the social achievements that we can have all the social rights that we can have then there was the because in Belgium there was the case in the Netherlands I was talking about it at the moment and also the
case of the Chibani in France who as soon as they have spent a certain number of months in Morocco and moreover there is in the process of being even more so they try to restrict life at the level of the French parliament to limit to only  I believe  three months spent abroad and well you have what was commonly called the minimum old age  that is to say this retirement supplement because your pension is too low since it is you have a somewhat choppy career you were seasonal you worked
You go to France for a month and you return to Morocco for six months and well you had this habit of spending six months here and there and there this habit where there was no longer the right and so as soon as you spend a few years ago well until today no longer of four months or more than six months it depended on either lapl or the minimum old age and well there they will try to standardize and therefore as soon as you spend three months and a day in Morocco as soon as we have proof that you spend month and a day
one in Morocco you have to repay all the overpayment and you are cut off from the old age minimum you are no longer entitled to it and there are quite large amounts we followed cases of shibani of years years years who had to repay euros and that there was no longer right to the minimum old age and therefore if you have real estate in Morocco well you can be most entitled to housing assistance for example to family allowances because it is estimated that you have a property
monk which is enough to pay the charges for the children etc and we can evict you from your social housing from your social housing because it is considered that having a real estate property abroad  that is to say a secondary house cannot give you the right to housing social so we see that this is yet another problem and here too things are delicate for our compatriots abroad if they do not declare their real estate assets in Morocco and well they can actually have s
yes if ever the administration for the moment the social affairs realize this heritage we make react perhaps professor who with us online on precisely whatrisk of happening once the application of this future law therefore already therefore the tax administration can receive the status the tax administration in the country of residence can receive all possible information on the situation of the assets held in the country of origin professor razeral e
t in this case  well indeed we call through this plateau the people who in quotation marks have nothing to reproach themselves for playing the card of transparency to avoid the impacts of non-declaration but that is to say that today all the members of the European Union which is home to the largest Moroccan diaspora households are concerned how  according to you  to facilitate making these transitions a little more fluid and accessible for this community of Moroccans residing there.
foreign especially in Europe there are two things first we must not forget the rather special political context and therefore this European pressure in general and certain countries in particular on the countries of the south of the Mediterranean therefore Africa Morocco etc that makes this first point in relation to the positive situations in these countries secondly the problem requires as she had asked precisely I was referring earlier to the governor of national diplomatic winner it is
 true that therefore we can have a national religion on the subject of this question because it is first of all the importance of our being not only of their transfer therefore it is an important community for for Morocco third element it would also be necessary that a clear communication strategy can be done in this regard  including of course official but also through the representatives of this Moroccan community in particular the famous Moroccan council of heroes so it
  They should introduce themselves into this debate to reassure them precisely because today there is real anxiety anxiety why because you have explained effectively the speakers have well explained the various aspects that arise I would like to highlight one element and that is economic advice and social Moroccan who recently carried out a study on the transfers of groupers and he quantified precisely how these transfers are used here locally these
t actually done almost all of it is used for social reasons  therefore family reasons  that is to say that the investments are really insignificant compared to all the transfers which are made to Morocco so unlike certain countries even in Africa compared with Kenya etc. we have a whole reserve for the investment in these transfers which is really very very weak compared to the whole which is social therefore and these are heroes who do not explain because I am lucky o
u I don't know I come from a region which is known for having higher migrations so it's the north-east and these people today are worried they explain cases to you for example you have a number which holds an account here you know to what to do with this account then a small account in general that I am talking to you about the almost majority of these mr it represents when we talk about figures we are talking about several hundred billion dirhams held by viruses which
 represent roughly the case the third pardon of all the deposits of Moroccan banks are held by mureux we have to separate things so the banks I do not have the details of the banks but if you have it yes share it with us what is necessary to do it's concentrated I don't know it but I know that overall it's really very very disparate you have the majority of cases they are small savers who have a house they bought a house an apartment or in which
there is a part of their family if it is not it is closed quite simply because when he comes they are generally rural people they must have a pirate and therefore he resides for a month or the time he leaves secondly they are also people who have a small account here the guard here because when he comes he has to spend on funerals for things so the others they are really included because there it is true these are people who are not concerned by these
problems but he is still worried so we have to explain them to themthe end and the outcome of all this there must of course be a national council precisely to deal with this question because it is eminently important so do not be content simply to tell it because also when you are told that they have to upgrade themselves that means so for these people they tell you when if these things are going to be clarified we are going to come into a rage to sell n
our houses and it's going to be a disaster so for us and for everyone because no one will buy if not we're going to brave precisely this good in which we have saved all our lives it's the same case also for their account they tell you so what are we going to do with the sequence if we are ever practically forced to do my etc and also in fact in not forcing them to close the accounts by forcing them to declare them there is a nuance how they react to that it wants
 to say that indeed there are many who have already closed their account it must be specified there are many who have already closed their bank account in Morocco to avoid official communication so that these people can know what to expect that's why that we are doing this program also it is mainly to inform this money how we are going to do it how we are going to do it by what means etc so I believe that these people and then there is a national interest also because this money
 interesting also our economy it's the transfers it's a large percentage in our balance of payment absolutely that we clarify these things even if we agree of course and everyone officially agrees there has to be transparency we have to go into well safe in peace with our environment financed my property because we also need foreign investment so all this must be done as quickly as possible so that the
Everyone can of course safeguard and their interests and be reassured  but while also safeguarding our national interests a last round table as president of the circle of Moroccan tax experts so of course there is consensus on the obligation first of all to communicate it is necessary to inform it is even especially that there they are they will start to return the operation started a few days ago beyond the informative aspect what are the prerequisites before the application
we of this law and the effective application already more important for me we must already start at the level of the government at the level of the banks of the insurances to think about the consequences of this lack of communication what is likely to happen if we continue in this attitude there of communication you have to you have to you have to communicate but other communication is there not a technological device that I know now also it's obvious we should also think about protection
 of the national tax base we should also try to reverse this threat a little bit perhaps through a threat yes because good it is strong all the same as a threat we are talking about a threat because all this risk because here we are talking about we are not don't know what's going to happen so imagine because we're talking about bank accounts for me all Moroccans living abroad have at least one bank account here so already when you're just talking about the lack of declaration
ion of the account is that it already poses a problem me what I meant is when I speak of reversing this this problem is trying to accompany to advise these people there on your tax on the entrepreneurial plan on the plan to try to encourage them to invest from one adequately by also calling on support from professionals so it would be necessary to change a little bit this classic mode of investment which existed for all people anyway whether they are emerald or
others need to get up to speed given this new situation in terms of international tax compliance there are cases of classic cases that are relatively I would say simple that I would say advisers should quickly be needed in an adequate way to reassure them for there are also cases that can also have I would say slightly more complex investments with arrangements I would say and present all the ifalso killings that exist because in
 these there are also some that may have undeclared accounts during declared in which there are funds that correspond to black in some way or so people need to know what it is and it is through this there again I would say the main element here is training how how what are the risks etc all of this is of course that it should be done perhaps with sensitivity etc but it necessarily requires the involvement not only of the Ministry of
 the economy and finance but all the banks the insurance companies even the consulates abroad or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs so you really have to get started because if now you fear a panic in the immediate future what will it be in two or three years many problems there is a risk of further aggravation just in relation to the data that is targeted there is the identity of non-resident holders and beneficiaries of bank accounts
s so we are talking here about names of course passport number contact details of the holder so address account number only of the account interest received so there really we get down to it finally you have to be ready you have to be ready to be up to date and completely transparent after that also comes under the attention of the holder of this account now the Moroccan state solve the problem but the closure it is declared if you close this account it will be declared we can also ask you the question in relation
t to the history of this history here it is that it has prescription that you mentioned just now liable for the tax administration in fact there is a medium-term risk which is the entry into force of this agreement with the cedea for the exchange of automated data if it happens for example  as has been said  the risk really says in quotation marks because it is not there is nothing sure about this project etc the time that the text of the law passes the application decrees etc in short it is not necessary that the
e Moroccan government that the Moroccan authorities that the banking authorities are waiting for the last minute the last month to tell the mr listen you have to declare because now change them automated because as said yesterday indeed this this history because the prescription it's not just from the day we will go back to another year as a general rule I think it's years in general for companies the current year this is the case for France here
so probably we are already over four years old maybe some countries are even more spread out so there is a risk we must actually start informing our compatriots abroad now  especially those who have nothing to reproach themselves for this is not illicit money is not money hidden from the tax office it is income that has been declared and well i have income in a bank account i transferred part of his income as azera says so that p
could be just a few thousand dirhams so peanuts it's not much but even if it's dirhams or more but it doesn't matter it's in accordance with your previous tax returns and everyone would come out won in the final indeed after there is also another context and there it's not in the medium term it's already today and it was even already yesterday you have belgium the netherlands also france maybe tomorrow spain or italy who are going who are in the process of tightening the screws pa
because they believe that indeed these are significant amounts and therefore those who benefit from social assistance from social housing or else do not pay enough taxes and well we are going to tighten the screw to squeeze the lemon as some would say to obtain more from these either binationals either who resides and who should pay more or not benefit as much from social assistance or social housing and the rise of the right in different European countries should not facilitate the c
even less change them in the future thank you very much president of the circle of Moroccan tax experts thank you for having answered our questions and the questions of the mothers because indeed you have really enlightened this public opinion on the duties but also the duties of the public authorities thank you too professor azzeralthank you for being with us by phone today and thank you dear colleagues thank you thank you for your loyalty to the news question very good self
welcome to all
predominant in the economy the Moroccan banking system has undergone significant development the banking law makes a distinction between two families of credit establishments on the one hand the banks and on the other hand the financing companies as for the banks they are divided into three categories the banking establishments of a public or semi-public nature which are initially created by the state to fulfill specific missions in terms of financing private banks which are

er that the employer regularly pays the contributions cocody fertilizer agencies to be ready thank you amy traoré is retired she wishes to benefit from the advantages linked to her new status since yesterday I don't know why I submitted my files to retire after years so it was you are wrong and danthony repairs what we know how to brush the tray angle yet what would we do barely minutes of waiting and friends are received by a manager since this morning I see on being
  that after analysis of tergnier albert the six helpers srm that tells me something alone here I do my thumb and it is in the form of doing the tontine like a bank it was like a beard cut off from the world you spent how long I did three years in I want to analyze your style a little I see that there are no apples from the passage of your passage from m did you have the right one I went there the lady who was responsible for it died and we couldn't even look for the p
apilles files we could not have it is the lady died so a difficulty is saying too much we will say a few years it is not very serious at her level since it is not her doing she worked in a company where she could not have the documents that are needed before the company closes so we have a special procedure in these cases but it is still important first of all to ask the person concerned  let's not look for what it is  there are elements on which we
could be called you will be able to help you move forward better in the file whose character also of students of treatment sabine takes the time to carefully examine the files of the sixty-year-old of the period of activity must carry out in the overwhelming and then that gives us eight years in four months with have not drawn if we have the information on the n and secondary in four rounds it would not be bad because this extension you benefit you will benefit from acape allowance
town and inform you not yet but not in fact to benefit from a normal retirement each end of the month it is necessary to total years of minimum activity therefore those who have contributed less than years therefore between one year goes and years months it is an allowance age of years years months you have the possibility of redeeming must see the treatment in your channel where the presents have not been reached to allow you to redeem the two years of contribution that remain but at least you will have a unique capital q
ui will be calculated on the basis of years if really it can really be difficult to use the document you have bring please mom a thought a copé ask to claim a pension it is important to have been declared by your employer and to benefit from all the documents incomplete files disappointed and in incomprehension amy traoré goes back home hoping to find documents proving that she has worked at least for years the cocody agency receives on average social insurance pa
r day cnps manages more employers and workers so a real strategy has been developed to manage this flow to ensure filomene and the director of the agency since but it depends because we are the room listening to our customers so we still take the time to discuss with to understand why they are there but to give you an idea we receive approximately and people per day every day or minimum people otherwise there are peak periods in rio since we can al
ler up to people not warm to the reception despite the good will of philomene what can provide this is the case of a retiree who is about to leave the j years old very angry hello madam for being angry you are angry in an hour the lady is there if you were two people please please what can i help you can i take care of you ma'am don't let go it's true it's really sorry but since you're angry we can still prey on you
to be in charge please you even mix the pensioners with the others that too that makes two that we promised from this August that's what I told you that there the objective is minutes but we have to take it into account of those who are listened to take the time to look at the files because we can also go and receive things in a hurry you have to look at the files you have to make sure that the documents that have been requested are indeed those that are there because once the tarots
if we have to be able to process them quickly whereas if we receive them and it's not compliant we have to remind you you have to come back to the fifth and that too it goes back and forth and it's not easy no to settle this kind of situation the cnps to digitize its services and set up a platform that allows users to register and follow their files without traveling to ivory coast more than workers carry out an informal activity and
therefore does not have social insurance the cnps is trying to set up a new scheme that of self-employed workers judicaël manages this project its victory is all the more pronounced for the risks under independent rooms the establishment of this scheme is there to provide answers a state of affairs which is that the majority of workers do not benefit from social protection because the statistics have shown it today the employment situation is much o
n going to say characterized by entrepreneurship therefore independent work individual work whereas until now the cnts its field of action was limited to salaried workers it is the target then as its name indicated the social system of independent work is intended for independent work not to work independent do in any natural person working on his own account and if not to better understand it is all these people who work for themselves  therefore qualities
farmers traders transporters liberal workers it is of course also workers in the informal sector but also workers in the informal sector which is quite developed in our country is what as I indicated more than workers today are workers in the sector informal judicaël by rejanoint its teams who since this morning have been informing and raising awareness among a group of associations of cocody traders with the aim of trying to
educate and convince traders with this new offer new schemes offer self-employed workers social benefits in the event of maternity  accident illness and old age when they are going to stop common good per month from there you tell yourself what I see there no there we are here today until we reach those who are playing today no it's not Thursday is getting back in the saddle the president who invited us we are going to have a few days yes and suddenly there is someone who
I pay for the passages who wanted to know more and that's it we told him what it was about the person is interested but is not a has not his room ul of a day where she would like us to be able to come back but as I tell you we came if the invitation from the president of the association who we hope will organize other information sessions and then recording you were waiting I have been listening since we started there is a certain interest in the regime therefore and it is a real lack I
 I told you that it was a response that we were providing to concerns whether at the level of formalized professions or of so-called informal professions  we are soon going to find that the CNPS is well filled because you see  these are people who often work until Monday evening because it there is no possibility of resting to claim social protection you must pay back your turnover per month convinced market traders do not hesitate to register massively to
u independent social regime who you are what interests me is that later the probe took off from the premises to the head of the cash register and by an innocence platform hopes to see a photocopy and perval and the certificate in any case about the month we can find this information above it's quite small we know it well they're absent living there what does she do in life exactly what job she started so where she lives and where she works it's already hard time to spend like a
wanted to contribute but not toxic is in confidence and it is good that to take a small nap any other matter including a two weeks passing under the moment then after that will automatically be on the part of a population to contribute to the little ones of the cursed dungeons of the crown is not a completely choice after two months we find it blows the young man on sick leave for seven months he has an appointment with his doctor it's an open fracture it's simple it was an open fracture co
completely with waters even who had become a little dazed which is a little out of place so well we had the choice and the foot is true that we look at his age the games we say to ourselves after that it will serve as an investigation we will handicap him well and then when we fell on it and we have the ball with the there was a little vitality so year we stocked up we did quite simply the intervention is good to the taste of the intervention and had no progress holding the big problem also is when it jumps you don't
you don't have the conditions in which he how it's going they are so when it's like that also wanted to find called with small problems and bigger in the east he suffers would have lacked patience in his convalescence a lack of rest which today poses a health problem a examination or even outright that there is a cut which is the review we will see if the calm of very good quality it is the radio which will tell us but probably you feel that caen it was operated in support r
quickly on foot this support on foot from there to provoke and train a small shortening really small rat concessions all that will be mentioned its coaches it was possible here stands up we will see that when we see this short duration we see this review we saw that it is a worrying day in time what will happen is that he will have pain in pain reassures so we will see if there is not a third wheel which will shift let's give these radios which will determine
ner sa once the x-ray has finished determining sand we will take the elite resolutions one that the doctor decides to give him a new x-ray to check the state of consolidation of the operation this is due to the fact he made the rejection of the plthat after the goal is non-respect that is to say and if the telepathic client is what partly explains the bare skin that one is yeah that the other is in the plunge reminds a little tasted of the wines that we say what is that one ignored the of
2nd trial elf and by the way if this went to look for the human mine linked systematically I know you are only tibia which little by little a gait convolant this radio or soon the possibility of restoring this possibility is possible and perhaps a little the not sir the pen correctly this aggression the time of the regulars has been slowed down the known this case when he speaks I am loose the sugar but the pc doorman continues leaves him like that and continue walking the ca
pot fights for all either attitudes of ease and if it continues to sell practices to avoid you never know if the same question he suffers has been taking painkillers and antibiotics for several months heading to a pharmacy approved by the cnps so that they blow make no advance fred applause how this in the patient arrives one it's idiocy it's first apparel consultation the green fund after his youth now falling
also file bis photophobia the declaration the national social security fund registers five thousand accident declarations per year for better care of its social policyholders it works with clinics six dental practices three radiology centers seven rehabilitation centers two optical dispensaries and pharmacies on the whole of the national territory return to the cnps of yopougon at the center of equipment and functional rehabilitation eugène following an accident
he lost his leg at work he came for the fitting of his prosthesis support at no advance fee ok but with us because we produced the test we will try to see but above all don't be shy that we were going but in the month of august is if you have pain if you have censuses don't hesitate to let us know why we see to what extent we can a little project that ok ok our we're going well a little well me ok I'm putting good
ok straightened up in May at mrs oka how do you feel there is no pain lawt one it is ok we felt good inside a body or take it and you walk very slowly here we go eugene has not walked for two years and there you have to you have to really go slowly bass but it's the first time since he recruited to have another leg that allows him to move without these technical aids from machault parole performed with the techniques but there he walks without being technical and the ilaha illa
 his prosthesis and the hates move each step of the patient is meticulously scrutinized by the specialists to detect the slightest flaw after several back and forth the loose prosthesis if he flew well we are still in the sawing phase of the test labs in common the patient between the bars parallel for more security because while walking you can see a detachment of the pad on the test ok you know you understand so there what are we going to do we already know that the patient and they can
ent correctly the prosthesis have simply glued and dream neither the orthoprosthetist returns to the laboratory to repair and refine the prosthesis of genes an adjustment necessary to be able to prepare the final prosthesis sir a lot together we are back yeah it is a test of two stones opposite and we going to try walking in lézinnes very slowly slowly don't force hockey this time it's the good one as many musics market as it smells of experience but these ready
s are in play i'm not afraid they'll fall the lowest on the death trend three more fitting sessions are planned to correct any imperfections and finalize the patient's prosthesis within days in the meantime eugene is eager to regain his mobility he suffers on his side is back at the medical adviser he has to give him the results of these x-rays and his x-ray transport bills okay i said i don't like he was going to approve you have you at the opp
dared i did not see he recalled that you are going to ask make a decision in this sudden yes in fact according to these sources but in ground modeution so your country doesn't want to stay straight no it can't stay like that so it's good but that's the attending doctor of val dauthie I'm going to pose with him you're going to keep otherwise you're going to stay in clubs and if it continues we it will stay like that no but tell some police officers for example to the one who will decide bad no
good luck for he is suffering because you are satisfied with his most beautiful dogs could satisfy given the reaction of the doctor woman a little discouraged will endorse this incubation period to be cut but public transport compensation after after the log in the white there is all that he is suffering was operated on a month later since he is completely at rest he should if all goes well be able to walk normally again in four months en the cnps has paid a put of billions of millions of
cfa francs for the medical care of the socially insured ladies and gentlemen I am at the headquarters of the national social security fund cnps and by my side its general manager denis charles kouassi who has been in office for good blood but he is the general manager at the summit so gentlemen here is how can we summarize social security in the ivory coast today years more than years in reality after its creation and especially in its current format cnps must say that the pr
social protection it is a mission which is devolved to the state of côtedivoire agree and heaps of côte divoire shouted institutions which are operational bodies to manage this mission so it is a concession of public service the cnps as such i have the regime of workers of the private sector point there it is true I have the system of civil servants and the cena which is the health insurance fund was recently created I have health insurance for illnesses for all people living on the coast of
ivory so here are in particular the three institutions which are ip s of the elders of social prebends which have a private status in charge of the management of public services so how to see between these three entities what is in reality your complementarity because we can imagine that there are a yes it complementarity already in relation to exchanges of experience in resistance of the given but especially between the cgrae and the cnps there is an agreement called coordination agreement which gè
re people who have worked in the two regimes successively that is to say that and you can start your career in the public sectors understood mr and then wanted to go to work in the private sector and vice versa and therefore to be able to not lose periods that will be used to total your your years in benefiting from a retirement pension we have a coordination which ensures that the time spent in one institution is taken into account in the other for this
to retire and under these conditions each institution will pay you in proportion to the time spent under its legislation how to understand today it is really workers who are unable to enter today I would say basically because they these people to work either in the private sector and by the suite in the bath in the public or vice versa and not today in their possession their payslip are retired what is the solution for these people then the situation
tion has evolved enormously because what it is a lawful declarative system if you have people who because you know that the art is done you start working but its thirty years after you take your cottage then the dairies and elements which at years which are not in our possession it is too easy and here we are and that is why we really try to do research as to the person does not have all the elements we are trying to see is what the company ex
ist always is the company at the same time when it was dissolved is there a liquidation in good and due form since we always want to have proof that the person through then Mr. kouassi except error on my part and for you can therefore confirm or deny between workers in ivory coast had neither health insurance nor pension insurance and then what is happening we have the impression that it does not move and yet neither to workers they accomplish their
rs daily tasks thatis what is happening concretely then its candle like mc veigh last years since you know the content was shouted in then the crooked and independent regime was created last year in so we do it also has a very significant impact since the state towards independence is who they are traders when they are craftsmen cd religious etc farmers so it is all these people there who had no social protection
ale now have protection on its workforce its workforce we are in the process of enlisting these people there what was the detonator or trigger for them to subscribe to your your proposal you have three needs retirement illness with due incapacity to an illness or an accident and health as such he speaks now that we move on to that of there is a need that they are satisfied from the tests which are alive today alo
rs in Mr. Kouassi the CNPS to disburse more than billions of CFA francs this is the information that we have for medical care is ensured which sectors are more costly for the CNPS incontestably this is the retirement plan for young people in debt absorbs almost all the expenses for services there are retirees who leave you know how it happens they leave home very early to come to the agencies to manage their files and why
I do not create a space dedicated to them and which must be confused I will tell the crowd or other policyholders if you take a trip to our agencies you have an account that there is no longer any influence we no longer pay in cash do not oblige with a concrete case and it is this situation I asked you or therefore I ask you this question because it is a fact which lives even if it is true that you have effectively digitized so this high school girl ps so it actually facilitates all the
s transactions but not everyone is skilled in digital and that a retiree who is used to coming to his does and we are going to deal with it is also their habits why does not result for example a space which is dedicated to them because the need is not not made to feel you too you have in the agencies made rates will see it there are very few people who come for formalities to us and there is less and less fat so perhaps in the past they had to do
e but it is not current reception since we are going to ask for total digitalization and even I tell you even the complaints because the human facts and the declaration of the worker is not obliged to move you the payment of contributions you are not obliged to travel even the complaints you do not have to travel now you can travel because indeed you do not master the computer tool you can there are many but there too we
 we know how to supervise them or that things happen pin cnps and renovates you have taken percent of the shares of the group enough in the thermal power plant so in each city is what at the base you are not in reality far from our company name of basis is what the insured retiree must remember at the end of this broadcast. What I can tell you is that our ambition is to ensure that the system is never again in deficit and you know social security which is having difficulties
are almost everywhere and therefore the workers the social city must really be in peace because sometimes I say in fact we are sellers of promises now passions division or of promises we are sellers of false but what does that mean say that a job how its activity we say you go to the cnps at the end of the firecracker dishes you will have a recipe that we can even calculate for you years calculated according to the projections that salaries all that there
we hear from you the same promises it is we who are here today that they are trained promises but when it goes to work and in years a headache we will not be there and if we have pope and provisions so that the system is financially ground and even sees that in thirty years in years it will hold us we will have been sellers of illusions while we must not be sellerstheir illusions what the actions we take today which are lasting acts
ity of the plan so that all that we are going to require is money to pay their was to value the head and where the insured of the plan but what does the insured or retirees earn is what in his daily life for a retiree does it change in his life has changed enormously in the last six or seven years we have made three achievements of retirement yes in the space of seven years it is perhaps the only country in the world which affects so much value at levels as important as the g
renelle concrete I tell you the streets of alsace of achievement in it is important of achievements in forgiveness and in it is a passerby of the evaluation when you do the accumulation follows the period it makes you around in the space of for the insured or to reject the retiree is this that this is what it speaks to him concretely what would he have his way like comparing to the rate of inflation yes but between a depositor congress of derivation of view of the aggressions of that means that not only
we allow plan workers there is the purchasing power which is maintained and which has grown since the revaluations are higher than the inflation rate and that is what is important retirees over time that that the amount he benefits from of the cnps must not have any illusions we have been doing upgrades for a year and I tell you if the face-to-face trial period of find out I do not think I like it here at his place in fact these people from
achievement and we have made the commitment to achieve perfectly every two years we have destroyed them with regard to family benefits yes we have multiplied by three the level of family benefits still within seven years with regard to achievements we have also made or work accident annuities we revised a first time a second time d imposing the common man just want to understand what he is entitled to and what may be in years years what awaits him
what also the spurs and understanding that is to say two things it is very important to understand what they are avoiding ivorian workers and retirees place the first thing of insurance size that whoever was born appears today in tintin yes he is going have it going maybe as it was that's what we call the sustainability of the plan the second thing is to avoid monetary erosion at revaluations that we regularly make it possible to maintain
ir the purchasing power you are not even told more than put the purchase points since I told you we the valuations expects at rates higher than inflation was all she and she can ask to make sure that and will always be paid thank you sir kouassi thank you Mr. Director General  thank you  ladies and gentlemen  thank you for following this number of minutes to understand the functioning of the national social security fund  the CNPS  and I remind you that we were

tés who agreed to be with me this evening on the farc set and you are an economist consultant in strategy and lusc management and facing the dollar at infi professor of finance and former magistrate at the court of accounts thank you gentlemen for having responded to our invitation to come as usual we will be there once again thank you the president of theCourt of Auditors must present Wednesday May before the two chambers of Parliament the report relating to the action of the Court of Com
accounts for the year this report  in a rather alarming tone  warns against several problematic aspects of public management and focuses particularly on the worrying increase in public debt in all its components the opportunity for us this evening to dwell on the dysfunctions noted by the report of the court of auditors as well as on the logic of the economic policy of the kingdom what are the main points raised by the report before us
 worry about this state indebtedness how did we reach this situation and how could it be corrected further straighten out its public finances alarming management question mark this is the title of tonight's show the court of auditors is ringing the bell alarmed on Wednesday May delight giteau a presented to parliament a report on the action of the financial jurisdiction for the year it points to a series of malfunctions in payments
nts of the treasury the court of auditors underlines the accumulation of arrears of payments the arrears of the vat for the benefit of the establishments and the public companies increased from billions of dirhams in to more than billions of dirhams at the end the second point addressed concerns the imbalances identified in particular the cessation of part of the subsidies granted to the regional education and training academies for the pension scheme component the court of auditors qualifies the reforms
my proposals d insufficient according to dre threw the overall proposals together of the schemes and will contribute struggling to reduce the current deficit because the contributions will remain insufficient to cover the commitments to pay the pensions the financial jurisdiction also addressed the lack of continuity of the reform initiatives of the civil service the increase in the wage bill in seven years and the judgments and judgments in matters of budgetary and financial discipline the figure
re the most shocking revealed by abandoning tokens and related to absenteeism in the education department recorded the equivalent of the absence of teachers for a year concerning the construction sites in progress the court of auditors mentioned the implementation of the organic law relating to the finance law is there already set up work teams to strengthen skills and provides for institutional partnerships and if through twinning with a group of control bodies
 public finances of the european union concretely the court of auditors is responsible for monitoring the execution of finance laws in laws which presents the revenue and expenditure of the state and which allows parliament to approve the budget the court of auditors also assists parliament government in several areas and reports to the king on all of his activities  well gentlemen  as usual on these subjects  I am going to call on your ability to popularize so that we
 can go on these things to go from tackling this in a very technical way but before we talk about the conclusions of this report of the court of auditors because we are going to talk of course about indebtedness we are going to talk about pension reform we are going to talk about the recovery of public claims investments the court of auditors let's get back to basics finally it does not eat bread to go back to the role of the court of auditors he missed the court of auditors the white man is an i
nstitution constitution that the constituent power has reserved for it a whole chapter in the constitution it is the chapter in a thousand ways that is necessarily synthetic control the counter-jurisdictional matter in matters of financial and budgetary discipline is also the management what is called de facto management i
will not enter the interior is also a quasi-jurisdictional activity or an inc audit and evaluation activity which means the control of the issuance of management control the issuance of certain thematic and sectoral reports such as thishe who on the local taxation that we saw on pensions etc. therefore it is a continuation of a succubus mission of evaluation that the court of auditors exercises due to the fact that it is an institution which provides a certain neutrality in relation to the others
s constitutional institutions in particular the parliament and the government in the operating methods of the evaluation this is what the court of accounts did which are the institutions which are controlled by the court of accounts all the institutions which manipulate public funds all the institutions which benefit either from the financial effort of the state is which contributes to the financial effort of the state therefore the perimeter which has been well defined it is defined by the law which defines in that
that sort of the perimeter of intervention of the financial jurisdictions by in some way the establishments which in their perimeter of action manipulate the funds of the state there could be wonderful public establishments as there could be private establishments of private law but of public capital so these are the public finances the perimeter it is defined by the field of action of the establishment sometimes also we must not forget that the court of accounts does not say o
rganes or subjects it can also audits and themes and in this context it could have in its field of action several institutions several establishments and then on a stakeholder also blank visions and which required the mobilization of another element to another activity which is of extreme importance in the context of the accountant's missions is assistance to parliament and if it is justified that the first president of the court of accounts appears before the
e parliament and others there is no debate but the debate is in offer mode but that is extremely important because the account is the court of accounts by the competence of these magistrates because it is a highly supervised institution today in Morocco and by the specialization of his skills he can issue high quality reports it is a free audit for public bodies and we must take advantage of it only I want to clarify one thing because it puts slips
nts by the press which considers the Court of Auditors as a repressive jurisdiction gendarmes as a no it is not its role its role and I think it is much more important than that the Court of Auditors is the guardian of the temple if you want public funds It is a sword of Damocles which is constantly hanging over managers. The population must understand that public money is lost and not squandered with conditions and criminal acts with bad governance.
ance and mismanagement if the wii the most important role of the court of auditors then precisely I have a question from khadija on twitter she reads what is the usefulness of an annual report from the court of auditors if they are not followed by dissuasive disciplinary sanctions in the case of financial disturbances of a criminal nature and it is a good brief it is when we see that they were going to fix dysfunctions either in court or quite simply of bad management there it is true that
 the question comes up because you said is it a role of gendarme is it a funny auditors ultimately who are responsible for the sanctions that can arise following a report from the court of auditors which is that they are clear about the mission of the court accounts is double it is a jurisdiction and it is also an organization or in some way an entity which audits the regularity of the management of organizations and public funds so there to respond to Madame x
 hours ago already from the declaration of Mr. Giteau who spoke of judgments in matters of budgetary and financial discipline ok already action also we must not forget that the reports of the Court of Auditors are communicated to the Ministry of Justice which after of course analysis could initiate legal or judicial actions or legal procedures if necessary and considers there actually it has a competence two half sisters of justice in matters but of which the in case
there would be bad things being done now in terms of management you know very well there is age and good and badmanagement sometimes also there are indeed forfeitures of difference between what is planned at the level of the texts and what they carry out at the level of the practice there it is an analysis which carried out by the court of accounts and knows the reports of the court of accounts which somehow reflects his conclusions this analyst this question it is interesting because
we are going to the most extreme side where we are in the repression visàvis certain embezzlements but also I will call it like that maybe poor management in good faith that is to say that basically what is happening in these cases is because what does it matter he baptized in a simple and non-simplistic way for ordinary mortals so that the population can understand but that we are then then the court of auditors when he carries out his missions especially his missions of ty
 inc is to control the management he liked he can detect a certain number of infractions they have to qualify these infractions he is infrasound who has a disciplinary nature  that is to say his role is to ring the alarm bell for the gisti us so that he does not resume this if for that the penalties are penalties are probed announce penalties that we sometimes put if there is something of squandering and the reimbursement of lindu that's new at the level of
  cody financial jurisdictions were in the request to the person concerned for the people prosecuted to reimburse the money this is the role of alcohol it may be that in the context of these of the exercise of its management control audit missions and detects it an act which describes as criminal the court of auditors is not a criminal court the procedure what does it say in this sense is to say that the attorney general for the london court prosecutor had to when he
 he must like he asks the gentleman from the ministry of the list of justice so that he initiates a prosecution a criminal action is only a criminal investigation on the criminal case but here there are two things that can go in parallel the disciplinary prosecution and well of course we saw a lot of criminal proceedings behind which it was the court of auditors but I want to make it clear this must be underlined I think that the role of the of the court of auditors it is necessary that the
 press tries to live gray and this because we are popularizing an idea that the court of auditors it is in the process of putting people in the talent that is not the role of the court of auditors in the process of the left of the construction of good governance in Morocco it has a very important role  that is to say that our failures in this country are not a failure in the criminal justice system cite a failure not sometimes from a criminal point of view a suitcase of bad management I think
s looks the relays the specific reports the activity reports of the court of auditors the actions of evaluation that the coast was doing are in my opinion and have all there too noted the neutrality of the net are provided with an importance of extreme relevance that it must be exploited with a positive eye and I even think of my students at the faculty good game the reports of the court of accounts they are lectures for me because it is onions to teach them what the offenses are in
 In terms of public finance  there is a subject that is very important that must be exploited  so does the Court of Auditors have the powers also we debated on this set of the finance law the finance law in executives final on the 1st the allocations of the budgets for the functioning of the state is what the court of auditors is also there to verify that everything that has been provided for in the finance law has been respected absolutely absolutely so it is like an imitation
séraphine is the superior control behind this public and the major document the basic documents in terms of steering a little bit of public finance it is indeed the finance law therefore the court of auditors actually carries out a follow-up an audit of the execution of the budget has besides  a lot of points and in a way constant to be noted in the context of the last report of the court of auditors on the matter so it was quite simply to proceed to a reconciliation between this
 that it was already planned orthe finance law and what was already executed and the differences have been analyzed have been reported now I would like to come back to a note on the value of its reports on the subject also a value I would say if jose say jurisprudential because what the court of accounts proposes and recommends has a value of georges police now we talk a lot about a
small few facts of findings have material sometimes these findings are in some way the result of a de facto problem the absence of a law the absence of a framework it is the court of auditors which has slammed and which recommends the review of the law or the implementation of the law setting up some kind of a mechanism that allows management to somehow re-manage and that somehow allows management frameworks for public finances on many occasions it was the court of auditors that recommended the r
view of the battery which governs a little the foreign exchange regulations in Morocco it is the court of auditors which noted that to launch there was an absence of status and kylie recommended the establishment quickly either of this status or the disappearance outright of that of this organization so stop a little the importance of the court of auditors is that beyond the character or the quantitative aspect of its work it is above all the qualitative and then if we follow the history of the reports of the
court of auditors they take on more and more weight and consistency as and when the misaligned laluque you no longer know the strong point of the court of auditors is that it has a normative approach because if we compare it with the others jurisdictions of broadcasting hours we put people we can we must health have made the sentence in the bath we put people present but after what did we win nothing we sanctioned the staff so there is no reimbursement of the undue thing
 that the court of auditors to wake up on this and second thing on the rope as in recommendations for improvement and that is what we need it is precisely what we will see today so in particular before we talk about social recommendations the court of auditors or yours one gain in interview since you are informed observers you read a I imagine this report of the court of auditors there are major chapters I asked you for a general overview if we had to if you had to
  here are the main strengths that you have retained what are they that's there the girl I you like the colosseum the share ok then the report of the court of auditors makes it a crisis of new tanks information first because there is already several information that is either slipped into the reports of the noach bank with regard to indebtedness it is by looking at the data report so there is a great reconciliation of two points of view vision is also there are other elements which
 are slipped into reports the tank but they are different from the close to the governor that's the pleasure it's a camp by the report of the court of auditors compared to the reports that are that are accompanied for different financial products there is a made analyzes a little differently the major issues that the Court of Auditors or the rat the report tried to raise and we can synthesize them as being linked first to the question of indebtedness and therefore to relating in
macro financial indicators that are linked to the twin deficits budget deficit balance of payments deficit the problem of the exacerbation of indebtedness the problem of the harbor shrinkage of public investment especially it reminds billions who have been amputated and he tried to to allude to some public policies  in particular public policy in terms of education and therefore national education and of course there are other aspects which have been overlooked.
ssés in this sense there the great tribes so I would have liked me I would have liked that there was a link between I dreamed in the Indian report against this kind of report according to and the programs from which the th commission of the house of representatives for your information we come to create very recently  it's been a year or at the beginning  a permanent commission at the level of the House of Representatives whichis called the Public Finance Control Commission and this commission should have been
establish a program of control and evaluation of public policies which are linked to public finances I would like this kind of report to have synergy with the work of the commission and that is what will give meaning to the assistance of parliament  but you know that the problem in morocco sen are multiple and diverse so the court of auditors the ratio of the curve to which we cannot say everything and nothing would have left messi for that he focuses on the big problems
matics we will come back to this later this case then the report the example example the contribution of the report of the court of auditors it reflects that this will of the state to encourage decentralization because there is everything to a whole part which is reserved for the work of the regional courts accounts so there is practically groningen in two parts the first is a little bit the work that is carried out on public establishments at a central level and then the synthesis of the work
x such is discovering regional then today and I would of course sure take a somewhat qualitative approach insofar as for the first time the in-depth analysis of this report really brings a lot of innovations because the court of auditors has gone beyond the stage of evaluation proper for arrive at some point at a kind of mediation and arbitration unlike the reports that have come before because for the audit missions in a way classic and conve
and tell him no recommendations but for the themes of the debt the theme also of pensions the theme of synergies we are going to talk about sectoral policies the ja of arbitration there is arbitration and the examination of the report reflects this this trend this vision of things and we have in a way and that we have to pay tribute to the court of auditors because we have there we therefore feel observers that the court of auditors is about to go to the
the next step is in a way to touch on issues that are general instead of being content with auditing public establishments or the perimeter of public funds here we are talking about arbitration because for once the president of the court of the accounts spoke of the will of the social partners to somehow arrive at a consensus concerning the part of the withdrawals your criticism have of course the close which was already in some way advanced by the p
public works is also the important element is that this report was also for once an opportunity to also interfere in qualitative management beyond money no more inspectors really initiative we are talking about absenteeism we are talking a little bit of the impact on the management of public establishments we are talking about a little delay the arrears of payment pass for teeth and respond to these new ones because this is the first f
see what we are saying be careful beyond the arrears beyond the fact that we have not respected what has been agreed beyond the fact that there are gaps and differences between what is very good conventional at the level of conventions the likes of the texts and what kind of comes out of the management beware of the impacts beware of the consequences that's where I want I'm going to bounce off what you're doing I think you're children of alluding
n to public policies that's an approach there is in the constitution I think the article talks about the evolution of public policies but we don't know who is going to evaluate public policies the parliament is provided for in the article are that it has an evaluation of public policies of a annually the House of Representatives the meaning on the eve of the elections in never worth a public policy in my opinion technically speaking and logically the Court of Auditors these
t the entity best placed to evaluate public policies in Morocco unfortunately badly with the words that the text does not allow it because the text speaks only of the evaluation of programs and projects does not speak of validation of public policies today we are in avacuum we are in a fast and I think the court of auditors indirectly through this kind of report is in the process of evaluating public policies when they in its opinion on management policy
tion of retirement that he is in the process of qualitatively devaluing some education policies and therefore I think that the legislator is invited to breathe new life into the game financial reductions by restoring his competence the court of accounts of the bridge is he will assist enormously the parliament to base its competence for evaluating public policies on new ones because we cannot confer this attribution go to the private sector born in the government the parliament and the
 to disarm to do it and I think that the Court of Auditors given its skills given the means at their disposal they better placed to see if they win the gentlemen to have this crisis was then one of the extremely important points noted for the time not you said it we talked we're just going to try to explain because we often hear about it without really knowing what's behind it and what's the point it's indebtedness we can cry wolf until the day after tomorrow telling ourselves that we're
t extremely indebted on sees in other developed countries we also see like the united states or france the debt ratios are still quite enormous so when we hear a public beast of morocco which represents in its gdp public companies alone which have accumulated billions debt guaranteed or not when we hear that we well well we have we are going to jump to the ceiling but finally explain to us what does that imply because the imf simply says that debt
in itself is not the problem it is ultimately what this indebtedness is for in terms of investments in terms of policy indebtedness is the result of a of a of a strategy of a policy of a set of projects that for a standard spent something very normal indebtedness becomes a problem for a company also debt becomes a problem for a state when there is default of payment therefore which is a problem of credibility when there are difficulties
to repay this debt and when the volume of the debt becomes uncontrollable this is where there is a problem moreover at the level of the Court of Auditors we call for a more vigilant policy we do not criticize the debt ourselves this is what is in the head speak talk about teeth whose project in itself even in the rainwater in the report we do not criticize the hold goes up because we control the shutter it is clear that Morocco is in debt and that the state is in debt to finance
projects to finance public policies which are proactive which really have objectives which reflect in some way a will of the ata strategies which are very ambitious which fall within some sort of the current which can of the will of the state to support certain sectors for to provide Morocco with the infrastructure for a lot of subjects so today the debt itself is not a problem the problem is quite simply control  monitoring and
the monitoring of this debt from when we say that it is no longer sustainable from when we ring the alarm bell either a level of debt or lack we are not going to talk to you about the quality of the debt also because it depends on who in brain loans following international standards I am referring to the European stability pact which defines that announced for Tibet but to explain to ordinary citizens have conceded above so there you go then good calculations
of the government and Cindy got closer but it's not the right calculation we have to redo the calculation and the Court of Auditors did it okay it's another thermos he redid the framework is perfect local and to explain to people what does that mean debt the republic in its structure it must be distinguished via an external debt it is an internal debt characters southern Morocco that the debt interest is much more important the more the external debt which finances the debt it is not
s the external debt how does Algeria etc. it's the debt what they make it from is this relaxation financing them scientific parliament on land and that's a big problem from point of viewe financing of the economy insofar as a large part of the game and it is financed over the years by the redemption of treasury bonds therefore speaks to the banks instead of financing the economy it finances public treasury deficits that is a big problem in what about the percent ratio i p
ense uniqueness in the finance bills beyond which are cited both by the report of the court of auditors that will speak hill old report of bank run run what it is how to justify the difference the difference exists y proud because in the government's calculation does not include two elements it does not include the debts which are guaranteed by the state and does not include social charges and therefore if we do the calculation then the setback means years we are in the tooth
so thresholds of beyond beyond good is dangerous because we had the case of greece in his case that he did not do who did not declare that they were not sincere in the declarations saying that you know that the fallout has been harmful but like emptying it my colleague the problem is not there there is not a country in the world that is not indebted the problem is your ability to support your debt is what the beast moroccan public and sustainable a
beware of macroeconomic indicators beware of indicators in microfinance and because it is necessary to line and this to other parameters the investor if one fits into the logic the own logic of the investor why investors are attentive ranging from investors when they see settling in a in a country among the indicators in cairo you dream and ours is the debt ratio simply because how you are going to finance your debt whether it is through taxes or not
s indeed defection at the level of the contracting markets and that is why the investors when they see unpaid which deafness compared to its financial capacities well they are one scared and then that's good so we will continue on this plan I give you the floor these farc is then of course we will talk about the recommendations of how did we get here and what are the solutions for the future we take a little break we come back just after two returns to the minu set
You want to understand with a little precision of savings Today we try we tried to finally they understood the role of the Court of Auditors its attributions what was missing compared to what you think the points which are ultimately lacking and which are highlighted by this report of the court of auditors we talked about the debt wanted to add something to learn that afterwards because you have no economy well it is financed with the budgets is financed with the debt but also
i by public revenue and there is a point which is still quite important which has been pointed out by these photos it is the low rate of collection of public revenue if it is necessary to redo the texts are clear the battery of texts and the clear ones effectively maintaining operational efficiency of the device of the devices in charge of the collection this is what was pointed out I believe that the county counts it alluding to the means the tools are spoken of the texts park
and that the texts are very clear now there is a reality in a way of collecting public debts which evolves over time  the behavior of the devices or the tools the means of collection must also evolve that we know that we are therefore in this case there are indeed pilot experiments which have proven their success in a way  particularly dematerialization  note that recently  just for the sticker to commit  it was a success
 as it was all the same an experience that was crowned with success and that today we are now pointing the finger at this aspect now also to a factual reality is that the real Moroccan economy is still experiencing some certain difficulties which explains why we're having trouble recovering and so we know there has to be a policy of some sort of a flexible way to increase and put pushers and operational qualities as we go.
and as it's not saying we have to reopen we have to be true itthere are of course paths not only attacking the symptoms and not finally the basic problem we have often spoken on this set of tax policies following the foundations of taxation with a larger base tax fairness etc. is what the court of auditors is there just to say here we have a low recovery rate but there is also perhaps an increase in this which would increase the q
amount of public revenue the figures generally say that these accounts of public debts I feel not recoverable are not resell or you that recoverable i.e. open not recoverable to recoverable you cover what technically or by time i.e. by default the accountants public even they make the leaders this necessary and do not manage to recover their debts for reasons of which to go into technical detail so I say that there is no
 not a real policy until now to ensure or access to create a real dynamic for the collection of public debts I therefore have two illustrations at the level of taste the top of the government the first declarations of Mr. two heads of government had to activate the att thirds of tensioners this is to say unfortunately scares people and withdrew on that at the time of the tax assizes what is it while the site a procedure which says it is not its creation if t
you understand it was hard it is its application it is an attitude if you do not quote a continuation a procedure which is provided for by the code of public debts second illustration at the level of cane taxes as they are business tax and shareholding the text provides that they go reviews who lay censuses at the level of the conduits by governmental decrees but I do not know a municipality which has done since it is the tax inspectors who do that so there is a problem
collection is first of all a winger there to the modernization and the tributaries to the modernization of the general treasury which is in progress alas it in the direction young people are making commendable efforts in terms of integrated management of public revenues I think the way there is still a long time too he has come to tax citizenship from citizens to tax citizenship the administration agrees he is making efforts but tax citizenship on the Mediterranean shore we have an annual policy
people don't have this greed and I don't see anyone in the Anglo-Saxon world they have some culture so that but the problem of collection there is a problem of collection only at the level of tax debts because I had only spoken to them about tax receivables there are other receivables which are of extreme importance I do not have figures but I have the impression that it should be these are receivables from public establishments which do not have a
n tax character and who did not have to ensure the cost of it the recovery in particular the compensation fund alas an important slate he has a large active file cover this the agents as for them do not do it and therefore they taxes in full public debts which is overdue and that solutions must be sought to ensure its recovery tax recovery and the costs of it depends on the effective implementation of the instruments which are provided for by the creative code
nces bull the code for the collection of public debts here are its heels seems to me that the collection of public debts and a business in any case if we speak of the potential for roeck workability of its debts it is a bit complex there is tax and parafiscality the debts which are public funds because these are clauses of public establishments or the establishment of two private companies with public capital it is complicated today to speak of potential recoverability it is c
complicated to put forward a figure it's very complicated that said today we still have to pay tribute to certain efforts I spoke a moment ago about the dematerialization of dreams which has borne fruit in any case here I give an example on the device we must act on the apparatus on the mechanisms to be able to increase this operational efficiency to increase the potential for collection but there is also the action of the government on the textsThe final contribution was units that
and even which has allowed the state to generate a huge amount of joint tax revenue today this is what must be matured as reflection would close its experience that is to say we have the texts and we have the recovery mechanisms these are the two aspects on which we must act so that we can increase this operational efficiency today if we start to tree this is in a way the nature or the natures or the categories of potential tax revenue that is
standard I said land parafiscal taxes it's really enormous now either we are going to standardize the mechanisms standardize the devices or we have to consume on the mechanisms which are with high added value with a strong real interest in recovery or we agree on the texts we have to is compared on text by on amnesia potential limited in time and space concerning certain stealing certain perimeters and that we can subsequently establish
  perennial rules may world that's it but the idea the idea is actually that these victims all have a debate today the court of auditors he points the finger there actually he evokes it is not the action in a few days so problematic but it is really very complicated today to say who would have one or more miracle recipes so that we can really boost awareness of public debts but we need it  let's talk about taxation  let's talk about tax rules so that we can
can arrive at consensual tax rules we must think about covering the state of course it will work on those on this path if the amount recovered or if really this tax revenue will increase we will certainly reduce the tax pressure today we must understand the state also the state it needs greenhouses between now and then to be able to function in the market to pay its debts we found because there is a figure sanaa is that state revenues are tax revenues for us
we are a fiscal state par excellence there is no tax there would be financing that is the starting point is the bella room a component which was discussed which was reported which was analyzed by the court of auditors it is the public establishments there it is a fact it is really a very important aspect today we can rap we can really recover a lot of money there is a lot of public revenue has increased by making state investments profitable  state participations
e the state but there are indeed quite a few observations there quite a few remarks which have been raised there have been a lot of recommendations so in fact we are going to talk about the recommendations maintaining a prudent policy with regard to the upward trend of the public debt more efforts to control the increase recorded including the volume of the debt these are the main recommendations of the court of auditors in its latest report according to the first president of the lamé jurisdiction
the improvement of public financial indicators requires control of ordinary expenditure  improvement of revenues and the continuation of the necessary reforms or even the initiatives linked to the broadening of the financial base to face the various difficulties which marked the year urgent measures were adopted firstly the control of the volume of public expenditure then the progressive application of the indexation system on the prices of petroleum products in terms of
employment  the reform of recruitment policies  training  evaluation and promotion cannot be considered separately from the reform of the salary system  this is what the first president of the Court of Auditors who was also interested in the economic promotion of Morocco and from the national product to the example of the strategies of several countries in this case India for Spain Great Britain Turkey and the United Arab Emirates they have all been involved for years
in the policy of the marc p label the label takes into account the considerations of foreign trade  investment and the promotion of exports to begin with it is true that we see the different recommendations that can be made in this report from the court of auditors it is true that we can ask ourselves the question how we got thereI've been there and what can be done to improve the situation that's the bottom line the court of auditors and sanction these observations its work devaluation
n by making a number of suggestions in the hope of improving it as I was saying earlier he has a normal normative approach and that is his main role he leads the state to rationalize itself further on different levels  whether in terms of budget management whether in terms of the conduct or governance of certain public policies and I think in terms of debt and the conduct of the state first of all have a certain credibility a sincerity in the
setting up your debt basket you have to candide the truth first you have to say you have the truth and then you know how to try to parma and recommendations it's good active debt management because you have to manage your debt in a way intelligent as my colleague said earlier the problem is not to be in debt the problem not to have the capacity to manage your crime in italy and the gdp and no problem he has the capacity to manage this he
suppose you have months of but your means do not allow you to manage is what we call who we are their guardian between the debt and the import is long and tomorrow for other public policies maybe we will talk about it casually just a question on how we has this happened is there consistency across all policies in terms of public finance it is true that in many compartments many policies we are no longer talking about politics we are no longer talking about strat
we are talking about a vision that ultimately makes it possible to go beyond all the electoral and political deadlines as and during the governments is what consistency in financial policy is there? so that's the eternal debate at the executive initiatives public finances are committed to doing legislative work before it becomes a matter
executive officials are low he leaves he leaves there are elections there are governments but the state is there so there indeed it's a it's a question of texts and I think that we quickly ended up understanding it when it's a cetacean is a sort of technical opinion before the text the organic finance law was a law that did not rely on results-based management this study management of orders that no ship have have of course we vote for a l
oi annual finances and we end up with the kids and this budget there we move on to the next budget there is so on today these data we manage to make it wait how we fall it is exactly this year there are really efforts that have been initiated in this sense today we are talking about a new organic finance law and the loire are which establishes new rules we are talking about a management based on results apart from policies p
public we have a law all the same which is very modern which is very in a way consistent which allows us today to speak of a management based on results based on performance based also on transparency today the government has decided since the January publication it said if you are a little bit of has given himself five years for the application of this law which is a revolutionary law in the sense of my sense of the term we are not going to talk a little pot of the word anymore
n an annual ritual or a finance law we start with a strategy of finance laws after our framing and we end up with the publication of finances at the level of some sort of official biton we are talking about a three-year law which would be adjusted annually and which could somehow bring a lot for the next finance law on the basis of performance we are no longer going to shake up in some way the establishments where the public administrations
cs to consume their budget we are really going to reward the good students in this area therefore against fiscal stability also because there are measures that are put in place and which change from year to year duringat the tax conference we talked about it crown is precisely for stability I was also that it's very very important also we also talk about talking to you a little bit about synergies that's the debate also at eternal we talk about it so much because there are subjects that
i are handled by several departments several entities by several stakeholders it has always been in some way highlighted that my let's talk about the social aspect for example there would be lots of ministerial departments of the stakeholders who manage it and sometimes it is a duplication today this synergy has not been highlighted in the report of the Court of Auditors and we have spoken on many occasions about strategy strategy strategy because the strategy will in some way
a kind of being declined in a way with all the possible synergies we define because the strategy is first of all a perimeter of the participants and the means if we arrive at is struck off relevantly considered considered this will allow us in a way to optimize enormously optimize the financial resources of the state in arriving at the same objective to review optimization I think that public finances have suffered from believing three phenomena that the new organic law you want the results
the states at least on the legal and institutional level for the implementation that is another question firstly if to create the necessary synergy between the draft annual finance laws and the vision of the state always we have had finance laws which are orphans these constitutionally even because the article I think of the constitution and reads the investment expenditures in the strategic plan of the state directly and therefore the hyphen was cruelly absent since t
always and I think the organic law through the three-year programming through the medium-term expenditure frameworks it will solve this problem second fluo it was the parliament which is the place where public finances should be influenced debated discussed in parliament was practically out because what to discuss the legal provisions which are inserted in the finance bill he does not have a grandmother he does not have an influential power over the finance bill v
u the rules of financial admissibility because he cannot he cannot influence public revenue in a consistent manner on expenditure most of the expenditure except they have a non-discretionary character that is to say obligatory the father's expenditure the debts to help him he remains the one on which he can react in a part was already engaged in previous years that's the height and therefore he wanted to try to strengthen the power of parliament as a link
u where public finances should be discussed in a fairly in-depth manner the third film this would be the traditional practice in Morocco a question that we can ask citizens if we ask a citizen do you know how a company meets and will tell you yes the balance sheet etc and when we ask him what do you know how the state meets he will remain speechless because people do not have a popularization of public finances and we do not know how it
parents when I give you an illustration which is quite striking during this period we are in the process of discussing the law of regulation the law of regulation if the balance sheet of the state it goes unnoticed even the partners the parliamentarian is disinterested little this law of rules the original law it is the balance sheet of the state would have told us that is to say how the state and here they are how I executed the god that the parliamentarians they authorized it extends to comeeau which do not go unnoticed and it
is a document which accompanies the report of the Court of Auditors and on which the Court of Auditors is in the process of making a declaration of conformity by comparing the accounts of accountants and public accountants and the general account of the kingdom. These are documents which are not popularized and I tend to what we need today in the era of financial transparency looks like access to information what we need more financial communication Morocco unfortunately and
especially to support regionalization art on the notion of accountability and this in three months judy çit is in my writings in my interventions that public finances are much more important for them to be the exclusive domain of experts and insiders it is public money people need to understand not in a technical way but that they understand what is done with their money but in a way enough and that's the effort of supervision of the state knew that the
 Morocco it is very backward in terms of open budget we are classified among the countries which in the budget why because when we do the questions on which we base ourselves to calculate Monday open of open budget jets we ask a citizen who is eccentric in a region of Morocco we ask him please you know something called administrative account do not know what we are talking about and here is your reaction just now when I asked you for a law of regulation
nt then it is a document which is provided for by the constitution it is something which is provided for by the organic finance law site in which prevails then even the parliamentarians I think that the number aman aman is because I have already done a study but which is not updated on the laws of regulation in Morocco the best number the best number of parliamentarians voted it was not necessary for an idea me if I judge evokes the technical part it is nevertheless necessary to pay homage a commendable work which
has been carried out by the public authorities is already a million openings a balance sheet of the Moroccan state which was already drawn up a balance sheet there is also an overhaul of the accounting standards of the state so that it is in line with international standards a spice so there is an accounting plan of the state that has been developed  which is really very modern  there have also been mechanisms that accompany this accounting battery a little bit  that's where I'm thinking  therefore  to death of orange id al alagi rather to integrated management
e expenditure and to act also the integrated management of receipts which would take into consideration certain somewhat technical aspects  in particular what is commonly called the off-balance sheet the liabilities which are not in fact in the balance sheets the battery is there the ingredients are there the law is the organic law of finance which explains the duration of these data to deploy it the goodwill also sanguine in my humble opinion it is absolutely necessary in some way to invest more put still
time master of the effort so that we can somehow accompany this reform that they a very important reform more than ever for public finances that oath we have helped in some way texts they are very good we have the state where the public administration has invested enormously on tools on some kind of technical reference systems it is absolutely necessary that we can use them a little bit now the most important question how do we harmonize
er in a way several repositories speak of a repository at its port its public we also speak of a price repository the quizzes of public establishments or what were disappointments by therefore from private law to public capital which are governed according to a little bit of a repository of law private then the Court of Auditors talks about it he encourages the transformation of a public establishment into a public limited company and encourages it and also the establishment of governance bodies they encourage
ent in a way yesterday's private concert so that we can manage the public and we talk about it a lot so the court of auditors is apolitical by definition but the reactions following the publication of a report by the court of auditors well they are necessarily political is what there is one is what it necessarily gives is that but in front of its responsibilities a government is can the parliament visàvis the government at a given moment use this report of
e the court of auditors to ask for accounts it is the canton word of the government said to accept and understand in a way the arguments of the court of auditors we will not have that I am there we miss this year there was no reaction there is not really had contrary to certain figures which were published in some way in the sauce was certain certain organizations there it is only there despite that we are of course talking about clothing donations by the world GDP so there it is already a reactionn that is fair play it is a reaction that must be welcomed the executive is in a way accepting and admitting nothing that it really is a change whereas before really there are silks absence of reaction is in a way a reaction that is mixed but there we are talking about a reaction that's there it's as if we kind of admit it's just an addition we're landing who doesn't say a word agrees exactly that's why there's a saying that has an aphoris
me that we use in the judiciary what the judge rules according to the conclusion of the parties at work as beloved I thought the main function of the court of auditors is to continue my bones continue to evolve regardless of political considerations if you make antagonisms that there may be here and therefore it is not the Court of Auditors according to the data which are accessible to it according to its analysis are a function of national benchmarking and the is in
in the process of giving his point of view as a hard superior control a superior control of public finances good there are other organizations which are either parastatal to the same constitutional council which in turn issue reports such as the economic and social council and the environment such as android banks they are in the process of taking up ideas on several several points which are taken up in the reports of its bodies which I have just quoted but the courtyard of the camps
are to force his neutrality his neutrality that you see that therefore the orthodox in his work and that we saw me when the president in blood his speech in parliament it is not followed by a debate we are not here to debate he is attracting their attention think normal that there are people who are not happy because there is not only the report the report there is not only the annual report of the court of auditors the court of auditors and the habit
to make specific reports at the level of the bodies and that I want I want to quote and I want I want to underline something for me which is important the constitution it provides for the publication of the acts of the court of auditors which adjusts slips in particular to general reports whether it is the judgments that it is in the process of issuing as a jurisdiction now there are beginnings but we want them to speed up because it will contribute to improving the case law we
 teachers even need to confront the case law of the Court of Auditors and I think that will give great points when the NRAs are published for individuals to install them the organizations that are summoned to their contract they will benefit more from it and I think and that it is an important ingredient to reinforce the transparency of the costs of a rather strong echo and very quickly very quickly I believe that today the court of auditors is in the process of taking part in the debates concerning
t certain reforms which are very very critical is very urgent crying words which are very very significant such as urgently necessary in my humble opinion today for public finances we really need a modernization action by institutionalizing the apparatus which manages or pilots public debts today we need a kind of its approach is a public finance body that will allow beyond the action of the government of the executive to act quickly
idement because the watchword in terms of debt management if the time is up but alain beretz foreigners on excellent evening on medi tv the rebroadcast at pm like every evening and I'll give you an appointment no

we can be a locomotive for productive investment because what it is really about is putting forward the implementation of a new investment model that is more productive and more job-creating  therefore the automobile industry sector in Morocco has achieved billions of dirhams in turnover in exports and is preparing to go towards billions of dirhams to approximately companies and a point of jobs then this transition will be accompanied by an im

welcome to the journal of economic intelligence the program dedicated to the behind the scenes of the markets in Morocco economic growth rhymes with Africa the Moroccans turn their back on Europe and bet on their continent to ensure the development of the country last spring the Moroccan community of economic intelligence to broadcast its new strategy based on the African Eldorado this strategy is based as well on the capacity of Moroccan companies to conquer markets in Africa
ique that on the commitment of the kingdom to support them our reporter john hutton wolf was in Morocco a few weeks ago he was able to observe the very offensive spirit of Moroccan entrepreneurs as shown in his report from Africa to Africa these workers who weld pons and assemble work for the Moroccan company Bouzid Shelly all the parts they manufacture are intended for an African construction site we consider that we Moroccans for years in this profession we have acquired experience
nothing and expertise through in particular the various collaborations with European countries which came to Morocco and we considered that we could legitimately serve as a transmission belt towards the south and to position Morocco as a relay towards these countries of Africa from the West which are brother countries which are African countries with which we share a lot of the language of religious cultural standards and miss a cultural proximity which can be
 prove to be an advantage for this large SME which has millions of euros in turnover  half of which is in Africa  a continent which does not frighten it on condition of preparing the ground by unearthing the right information. We also have subsidiaries in countries with bosses of subsidiaries who work on a daily basis on  I would say  strategic information by being a member of either the Moroccan Senegalese friendship circle or others so the information is everywhere whether at the level
u institutions at the level of the mining or energy industrial sectors so we try to capture information throughout the sector but hrs would also like to capture the attention of the Moroccan government can do better to support Moroccan companies yes and I think that there should be awareness at the level of institutions and governments and supervisory ministries to be more supported by companies like ours
 who need the sovereign power to go to these countries because going to export to Africa requires a lot of energy hafid elalamy founder of the sam insurance group prefer to turn to the private sector to find out about the competition his group employs people it is established in the country hello call to economic intelligence firms which are present both in Morocco and abroad but often in Morocco with quite advanced knowledges and searches in
very advanced training allowing us to be alert to everything that is happening in the region and to have more precise information on the acid that we are watching to know the African market these economic opportunities its strengths its players it is the ambition of the financial center of casablanca it is positioned as a hub for the east and west of the continent this is where you cannot fully occupy this african strategic dimension its positioning in africa to play the r
ole as an entry platform to west and central africa has now done a little bit of aggregating the region's opportunities and offering international institutions wishing to set up in this region a business environment that is as reliable and fluid as possible to enable them to access its potential in global economic competition  morocco's ambitions are being played out here in africa to win its place  morocco is counting on its strat
national economic intelligence team well with me on this plateau abdelmalek alaoui hello you are managing partner of global intelligence partners which is a strategy consulting company you participated in the development of this new Moroccan economic intelligence strategy so first question why europe why precisely africa africa and in the natural extension of morocco's economic ambitions and as you know europe has had a severe downturn phase
re year which intensified with the financial crisis morocco projected itself towards its south because first growth was forbidden to it in the east as you know the borders with algeria are closed and therefore morocco had to be imaginative and deploy in this space strategic and the uemoa zone and even a little wider all of west africa where he feels legitimate in confidence in a strategic space where he feels good he will flow man europe is what you felt that the
 doors were closing or is business much more complicated today with the crisis in europe business is changing and we feel that europe itself is looking for a model the great debates on deindustrialization a certain number of very important subjects which aims to stigmatize companies that come to produce in the south are elements that have favored the tension of many economic actors who finally said to themselves that it was more interesting
trying to be able to go to sub-saharan africa where double-digit growth is not sluggish as it is in europe and where moreover the markets are more open and where the future is much more promising from a point of view a collection of information is this continent africa is an easy continent it is not an easy continent but neither is it a continent where it is extremely complicated to collect structured information that is why we believe that actors
rs from the south are better equipped because they also understand the different social ecosystems and they also understand how to collect information with very high added value from the actors directly we cannot trust the press in the same way as in europe so it is very important to obtain primary sources  that is to say people who have qualified information and to be able to trace it back and as such I must say that companies and in particular
Moroccan economic intelligence outlets are particularly well placed to be able to do this work so relays which are easier to do because there is this very close cultural side this is what makes the difference for Morocco I think there is a triple dynamic there is also the fact that many African countries have a very strong postcolonial feeling and want to work less with the former colonial powers with Morocco there are civil ties
national religious and extremely strong ties of cultural proximity as you know morocco trade as far as tombouctou so there is this proximity and there is also this feeling that moroccans are first and foremost partners and not people who act like predators towards this economic space then so you do this new strategyie economic intelligence and you decide to go to Africa  does it happen naturally in Morocco  wouldn't you count on what it takes
that it is a movement which is carried by the state in such a way that everyone is behind this strategy we have an opportunity in Morocco is that Morocco is built over a long time and the steps initiated a strategy which was previously called economic diplomacy african strategy events from the end of the years and it started with the financial sector then with telecoms today morocco telecom is present in five countries in sub-saharan africa it is substantial and then it is
is to go to many other companies until the cases of music is said that you have shown who is a big sme which today exports only the manufacturing industry so I think it is emblematic of this transformation of Moroccan industry and this reservoir of growth which is available to companies which is being deployed in Africa so there we understood that there was the framework we can read moreover your strategy of economic intelligence however we saw clearly there that the boss of musi
that he says we need help from the state why and on what sectors they need to be these companies you have another personality who intervenes in the report who is also emblematic of the transition my effects of their friends is now minister of trade in industry after having been a very big boss in Africa so I think it is the operational translation of this African ambition of Morocco to be able to create this mix of this cross fertilization and
between the public sector and the private sector and not hesitate to look for skills in the private sector who know how to make Africa the state cannot do everything. This is why we think within the Moroccan Association of Economic Sciences that drawing up a road map for a national strategy towards Africa was the responsibility of the private sector we opened the way for the state to operationalize so what the state must strengthen to help these companies first
to work on the question of intermediate consumption for exports there is a big concern is that Morocco is very important for you to see our re-exports that it is necessary to work on the national added value years by putting a whole administrative millefeuille which allows to have incentives in exports it must also work on the climate of competitiveness in exports and also allow  through a federating economic intelligence body  all these companies
e to be able to access qualified information federating bodies you mean a little on the model of France a kind of grand delegate a term for economic intelligence whether they are interministerial that's it that's the model or not not at all on the model of muscular strength on the contrary Jean we think that Morocco must have a Moroccan model and the Moroccan model means that we must find our own economic intelligence systems in which all the actors have
interest in cooperating as you know the sovereign administrations the central administrations do not like to cooperate with each other so we must imagine a more flexible system which can take us forward and this more flexible system it will pasqua through the cooperation between the state and the companies and by the creation of a kind of two places where all the actors come together we think that the first the first step is the creation of a government big data we will then have to
to pool all the knowledge that is produced by all the actors it is considerable in Morocco whether at the level of studies at the level of strategy or at the level of a certain number of things which are produced by think tanks and by the scientific community we must be able to construct meaning collectively  this is the whole ambition of this approach to direct towards Africa or to think of an internet type device which is accessible to everyone I think
if there is a lot of debate on the question of data security at the moment it is a subject which is recurring I am for Morocco built on software autonomy is therefore that we have a Moroccan system made by the Moroccans qthey are secure which allows all the public authorities and strategic actors in the private sector to be able to maintain a conversation we are today at the center of the conversation on africa we need to have the means to
 our ambitions thank you very much abdelmalek alaoui the show is over but as usual you can find it on france points like goodbye

american seat supplier lire core and the french component manufacturer valeo large multinationals including boeing airbus and stellanti are also part of the moroccan landscape their presence has helped to generate tens of thousands of new manufacturing jobs these companies take advantage of morocco's state-of-the-art infrastructure such as high-speed rail modern industrial areas and a wider motorway network linking the major cities of the bloomberg kingdom

  hello everyone and welcome to urgent economic fact it would have escaped no one that morocco and france have been experiencing a diplomatic cold for several months so the affair and the recurring each time there is the left in power in france it systematically gives rise in diplomatic france but today the deal is fundamentally different because the political movement which currently rules france cannot be described as either frankly leftist or frankly leftist
straight but we still have a problem so if formally the cold is of a diplomatic or political nature maybe it is also profoundly economic or not and we are pleased to welcome today to speak about it our guest mr mustapha tossa hello hello so I call back for our listeners whether you are a journalist and political scientist you are Moroccan French or Franco-Moroccan it depends on the point of view of the place from which we speak and my first question may
uton say as some say that the problem is fundamentally economic and that the diplomatic dimension is only the expression of this deeply economic problem between Paris and Rabat then I would be tempted to say the opposite the problem is fundamentalpolitically and it can have economic repercussions but until now  moreover  there have been studies and articles published in the press  particularly in France  which have noted that despite its palpable tension
between the two Moroccan and French authorities there has not been a major economic disaster in the street in the relations between the two countries the trade balance and all that is unbalanced and respectable between france and Morocco the investors mount french are still there the ambitions to devote a French presence on the Moroccan market and perhaps eventually on the African market through the experience of Morocco it is still there there are recurring visits
including French employers who come to discuss with the Moroccan authorities so we cannot say that where we live because of this diplomatic tension between the two countries an economic disaster I see it differently so perhaps only among the consequences of this political crisis it's hard and if we can't find a solution a way out of the crisis maybe it will have really economic translations which would undermine economic cooperation
e intense that there was between Rabat and Paris perhaps but for the moment we cannot say that we are experiencing an economic crisis between Morocco and France a crisis perhaps not a catastrophe either but there are still very deep movements that we have observed that there is perhaps a form of illusion in relation to this but there are firstly French companies established in Morocco which have been bought by Moroccan capital so perhaps it is in the nature of things
s these are movements but we can interpret them as being an attempt by Morocco  perhaps to eject or sovereignty part of its productive apparatus  we have seen it in the banking sector  perhaps in other sectors in the future and then on the other side  we have seen that Spain is in the process of once again becoming morocco's main economic partner within the european union even though for a certain period of time it was france so there is a movement in this graph map
ic and this movement is completely logical and explainable in my opinion it is that from the moment when you have a tension at the highest level of the state and from the moment when you have political differences between Morocco and France at from the moment you cannot even you are not even able to organize a state visit by emmanuel macron to morocco or from the king to mohammed vi in ​​france necessarily fatally the consequences the collateral damage is a withdrawal or a
beginning of a decline a decline in capital or companies or in French influence on the Moroccan market this situation is completely unexpected except that there is an awareness of this reality and this awareness has been at the origin of a certain number of extremely important political visits among which we can cite the most recent is that of the erection of the boss of the Republicans on the right and when we know that the ribes the Republicans on the right are these are pa
rtis politicians who are very close to the French business community and the obsession of the French business community is precisely not to lose ground in Morocco not to lose areas of influence to the benefit of the Spanish  Chinese or Americans so I imagine that it is if he had come to Morocco it is also to convey this fear this French obsession with losing shares of approaches that the problem is with that your problem is with macron and not with French capital we
we are against these tensions we want to do business that's a bit like that the message yes yes it's a bit like that moreover in the middle of the crisis and in the midst of disagreement between france and morocco there were a certain number of very influential voices who have published articles that have organized meetings that have fabricated messages for the lélysée there is destination demmanuel macron telling him to be careful there are there there are red lines that must not be crossed because we risk pe
rder a lot to Morocco if you leave the situation as it is and if you do not make a decision to mend your ways with Morocco to reconcile with thee morocco and to put the franco-moroccan relationship back on track a little bit within the rails which should never have left are important precious and strategic lines so there was this alert was the message heard by emmanuel macron was that will be translated into positions taken in particular for ju
to straighten out this crisis between Morocco and France  that's the whole point  but there were these alerts  there were these red light messages which were carried by Érica which were carried by French employers  a delegation of which would be in visit with a visit to Morocco so many signals that are sent to the French diplomatic political authority by saying Morocco is an essential partner we must not let the situation deteriorate because we would be we could be
re the first losers of this showdown especially since france is in the process of losing its footing globally on the continent we saw in mali burkina faso the central african republic and then there is a contagion effect which is spreading to other west african countries or sahel countries but then if the problem is not economic that the economic dimension is only the consequence a deeper problem then where does the real problem lie because there have been a lot of clashes
sh or rupture patterns and the question of quotas in relation to the visa then which affected several countries of the maghreb morocco algeria tunisia but morocco was part of the lot always with the pretext of a technical problem morocco does not repatriate those who want to be expelled by the French state secondly there is to do pegasus which was published by the question of the european parliament what is pointed out from the right morocco do not show any evidence in relation to the accusations and then to the question
from the often awkward balancing act that France plays between Algiers and Morocco so these three elements there or four elements that I mentioned what is behind a first cause which would be the crux of the problem yes everything all these cases that you mentioned and I will also add the resolution of the European parliament which is criticized Morocco and of which a large part of the charge was inspired or even organized by deputies of rebirth which is the party of everyone then for
for me these are just symptoms that reveal a malaise and a much deeper divergence there is between france and morocco today the two countries are at a crossroads morocco has made a clear request in relation to french diplomacy in telling her that it is time to get out of what the king of morocco and diplomacy calls the gray zone the comfort zone it is it is unacceptable to continue to hold the handle in the middle not to be totally for the moroccan d
u sahara so as not to displease the algerian regime and until now until a certain date and i will date it from the american recognition of the moroccan in this situation is astonishing was salable in relation to french diplomacy by saying finally france is is one of the first european countries which from the moment the option of autonomy was put on the table france said this is one of the serious credible solutions on which we can work the f
rance defended this option in the international ones in particular the united nations and the authorities of the european union so it was until this date there it was a very positive french position with regard to morocco and morocco was grateful to france for this precious support internationally but there in this case the initiative was French it did not come from others atlantic and then Morocco and then we did not yet have an element which came to disturb everything to question everything
what is the American recognition of the Sahara of the Moroccan Sarah and this recognition did not come alone it came accompanied by a major strategic evolution which is the signing of a tripartite agreement between Morocco the United States and Israel and this element there has completely beaten the cards it is a major development in the region which has not necessarily been applauded and accepted by a certain number of European circles  particularly French  because they consider
ent that in this meadow square of the French influenceise in this European neighborhood came two military super powers that are the United States and Israel and they built built a security defense treaty with Morocco this reality did not please for example and then and then and then there were all these questions that you cited earlier were ways of showing his bad mood to show how he could not openly say we denounce this
treaty because the countries still remain sovereign Morocco can multiply it's not Washington on the other side it's not important European cannot denounce head-on it's imposed on these countries in other ways the use of other situations to other means to send messages between quotation marks settle scores to settle scores and to remind us of their harmful capacity and that they must next time be integrated into all diplomatic dynamics to make the
  coin change return the favor so we are witnessing that but in my opinion the configuring point of this new period is this treaty it is this agreement which recognized the Moroccan of the Sahara and which established a solid alliance extremely important on the military and economic level and strategic strategies between three countries which seemed to particularly annoy European countries  notably France  so instead of there being a face to face argument of truth for
ur to ask the question besides during the visit of the French Minister of Foreign Affairs Catherine Colona remember there is a press conference with the Moroccan Minister Nacer Bulla there was a sentence from the Minister which was very important and which perhaps went unnoticed it is that he tried during this conference to say and send a message to France and Europe by saying that if Morocco multiplies its partnerships diversify these relations
 Internationally  the traditional friends of Morocco  notably France  must not feel threatened because these partnerships can be beneficial to the partnership  an important military relationship with the United States  with Israel  that this will necessarily be detrimental  that this will necessarily exclude France from this game and moreover the interest of Morocco it is necessary to convince French diplomacy to move the lines of its diplomacy on the Sahara is to establish a real partnership g
agnantgain it would put the means together the investments together the expertise together the networks of relations that Morocco has acquired in a certain number of African territories to set up gigantic economic projects which are win-win  beneficial for the French and Europeans but also beneficial for Morocco and beneficial also for African countries because that's actually the new Moroccan strategy is to invest in these African territories and thus
ire to win over the African citizen with his investments and not to remain in the logic of economy of predation which has until now been the rule of a certain number of French companies which come to collect all the wealth of African countries and which leaves them only crumbs to so much so that we can find ourselves today in African countries of immense wealth but with unspeakable poverty so that's this balance there it can't work it can't work there
Morocco has become aware of that  we can only benefit from the wealth of Africa if we encourage Africans to benefit from it too and that is very important and that is why Morocco in a certain number of countries had a much greater facility to penetrate the market and to settle and make take a form of author hotel like the fact of French capital often then if I understood correctly the French employers do not want this diplomatic criticism it has every interest in this
what ends french diplomacy understands that it is not in the interest of france to maintain this scheme because already the father who is everywhere and she has no interest in losing a partner like morocco then if all these beautiful people there understood that he has no interest who is pulling the strings can we talk about a French deep state can we talk about intelligence can we say who is behind in fact acting independentlyment of the interests of france via france makes it the
the question is to know why neither until now neither the influential business circles nor the no less influential diplomatic circles have succeeded in convincing emmanuel macron that it is in the interest of france to change its posture with regard to morocco so there on this question there is a real non-problematic problem specifically French it is the relationship with algeria since emmanuel macron came to power at lelysée during the first term he started from the principle and
t of and of a preconceived idea according to which Morocco is a friend to whom and that given the nature of the relationship given the duration of the good relationship with Morocco whether it is under the left of mitterrand or on the right or even if there meanwhile had a crisis with François Hollande and the two Moroccan and French partners managed to overcome it from the moment when there was this Algerian quality and their protest movements and then in the saved by the regime was saved by the co
vid today is an open-air prison where human rights violations are daily or press freedom violations are daily despite all that emmanuel macron the french state has turned a blind eye to this situation and so far if we take stock of this macronian approach can be said to be a failure insofar as there is a country which is morocco which has insisted on telling the truth and sticking to it because no  but already a failure in relation to the temptation
ive to turn the page of the algerian drama of the algerian parenthesis i am already even on this ground there france has not gained much and besides even the french are beginning to recognize it they have they have set up a president commission and an algerian historian to reflect on the tracks it is a commission so far remained the other dead he did not he did not arouse the enthusiasm of the crowds he did not force the admiration of the elites whether it was French or Algerian so jus
that now we are much more in the expression of a pious view sometimes of pure political agitation but without great results  whereas when at the beginning manuel macron left with a real idea of ​​​​launching a project that would be crowned by a real memorial reconciliation result he is at the almost half of his second term he has three or more years left for him and nothing changes at this level except that he fell victim to a kind of Algerian blackmail emotional blackmail blackmail at
 history blackmailing culture blackmailing the economy by saying that france must not at any time adopt the point the american position on it must keep a form of status quo status neutrality which has its advantage more than neutrality in reality a status one status that would prevent the resolution of this crisis because in fact the Algerian regime has no interest in this crisis being resolved because if this crisis is resolved  its internal contradictions ex
act and then she gave he will be confronted with a demand for democracy of economic transparency and and and and of interpellation on the part of Algerians where have you put the wealth completely the media of Algeria which which is counted by millions of billions of dollars so there was this question there which means that the Algerian regime has a strategic interest in ensuring that the crisis lasts in that the status quo continues forever and we can have a solution to the crisis of zara don
c if i just understood we two invoke the maxim that by dint of wanting to run behind hare we risk not catching any that is to say that actually there at the same time france has an interest in having good reasons with morocco and at the same time it here is not the friendship of Algeria but to turn the page and Ramadan and therefore by dint of wanting to maintain the status against the two perhaps the possibility of losing the two in the long term yes yes in the long term we could even consider it
e personal chess of emmanuel macron because when he came he was a man who had a new dynamic who had ambitions he wanted to shake things up he wanted to invent another way of doing politics to do diplomacy international relations remember the premieresrs months or the first years of his first mandate he was everywhere and besides he loves it he loves it intervening in international forums and being an agitator for the news
Internationality therefore has arrived this North African crisis and we feel that he is silent even when he is asked the question the last time the last time during his press conference he was asked this question what he found to say that the relations between morocco and the king of morocco are good and there is no positive problem immediately after came a completely official delegation saying no relations between france and morocco at the moment we are the good ones
news but nothing at all so it is therefore we must not invent a new reality yes indeed emmanuel macron today so we must also say to the credit of emmanuel macron it is that this crisis intervened on the margins also of a major international crisis ukraine we got out of the cause of covid and its immense economic consequences and we were entering into a military confrontation which could threaten world peace at the same time there if I compare the president already
in relation to diplomatic management you confide in rue feuilletée on the french side if we compare to what nicolas sarkozy had done who despite all his faults the success nevertheless go to moscow and obtain the end of the conflict in georgia finally although the farkovian method was much more pragmatic and realistic than the verbiage that we currently see in Macron's entourage but which in reality aims to hide a total alignment of these Washingtons in relation to the Russian question and a
Ukrainian yes it must also be said and there I believe that Emmanuel Macron sinned a little bit by a form of naivety and he wanted both to support the Ukrainians to ensure that they have the maximum of economic and military aid and at the same time to dream of maintaining a channel of communication and negotiation with vladimir putin what turkish erdogan managed to do because erdogan she did not apply the sanctions of the international community an alternative to the
 question of wheat ukraine so he wants at the same time it seems so in fact it just seems like someone who is able to talk to putin but in fact there is nothing concrete by giving nothing and it even ended up provoking him fears finally criticism from the ukrainians and from a number of eastern european countries saying stop betting on the ability or the possibility that putin will negotiate a compromise solution with the
Ukrainians if he is not beaten militarily if he is not obliged by a balance of power but to return to our file then after the American recognition of the Moroccan of our Sahara which you rightly qualified as a tournament and as you say there is a before one after there were three countries which were strongly dissatisfied two for two at the limit we can understand spain france but germany at the beginning so we must remember that germany when there was the d
decision of donald trump to recognize moroccan sahara one of the european countries which requested an extraordinary meeting of the security council to invalidate or attempt to invalidate this decision it was germany that is to say how much germany at the time was very hostile to this moroccan approach because Germany at the time there was a partnership but a privileged relationship with the Algerian regime and then it did not have a particular friendship for the politician for the ma
roc then what has changed it has changed that in the meantime given this skin of aggressive positioning of germany there was a Moroccan diplomatic investment in germany there was hand-to-hand work and then above all there was a change of ministry inside affairs and even a change with the crazy departure of a new chancellor so all these elements made the Germans realize for a while and probably also for economic reasons
s profound the needs of German green industry and also the development of factors that Moroccans used as arguments of persuasion conviction that resulted in what theThe Germans change their focus and adopt an attitude much more favorable to Morocco  less aggressive than it was when they tried to thwart the American position  so to conclude what  according to your views  could look like global warming between the m
morocco and france back before the crisis no i could see it who could i don't believe because morocco is on a path or who was well summed up by his majesty king mohammed saying we look where we assess we were going and our friendships and our partnerships in the light of the positioning on the Sahara because this positioning is very important and I do not believe that we can go back on this maxim which is a vision a Moroccan diplomatic doctrine
caine so what morocco expects from france is at some point an awareness of this french diplomacy that it is in the interest of the region it is not only in the interest of france it is in the interest of peace in the region of democracy in the region of economic growth in the region that all people of good will converge to put an end to this crisis and the expected change and that France participate openly in supporting the plan for the autonomy of nations
united to make it the only way out of the crisis so will it be done during macron's mandate some say no they say that in any case morocco has time ahead of it what is three years four years it could she could manage this status quo of cold and mute crisis until there is a change of tenant at the elysée whether it is a woman or a man and with this person new president to the president open a new page which
for sure it is that we cannot come back before and we cannot act as if nothing had happened there is an extremely important Moroccan request to France to recognize the Moroccan of the Sahara and a last word which is very important Moroccans know it they are right to believe that once france changes its position or clarifies its position on the sahara file this file will be definitively closed that is enough to say how important this is the parisian lock the
a big Frenchman and very important to settle this question and it is and we understand why there is such pressure such a demand from Moroccans for this French lock to give in and adapt to the new international climate and at the same time there is such Algerian relentlessness so that it does not happen there is nothing put can digest that the fact or another country but not that France it is called politics of the diplomacy of arm wrestling and the subcontracting of influence of influence
 the algerians are doing everything to bend france and the moroccans are doing everything to convince france to change its position and to be in favor in a strong way here is autonomy so that to definitively close the adventure of polisarian separatism in morocco and then perhaps that esteems hope would be that world would be that macron being in his last mandate his second mandate in general there are more stakes the period to lose decides to make recognition of Morocco s
a diplomatic victory he will go down in history and before leaving maybe the few months before leaving then we risk surprising you me personally i am not i will not be surprised by an acceleration of this kind on the part of macron he may not do anything do and how he can cause an acceleration of history create an event an important event the best for the worse like causing a breaking news a major change in the region he is able to do it
re and as you said it's well said he has nothing left to lose he wants to go down in history here he wants to mark he wants to mark history what a great other way to mark history than to participate in ending a regional conflict that has been going on for years thank you very much for all these insights we hope to see you again very soon and I also thank all the people who followed us and as usual I'll give you an appointment next week for a new episode
how morocco became the e economic power in africa in just the last few yearsd kingdom of North Africa has experienced dazzling economic development which has surprised more than one it has gone from very indebted poor country to continental economic superpower in just a few years it is just extraordinary but how all this was possible what did Morocco do to transform itself into this point and as quickly this is what we will see in detail in this video to fully understand the
evolution of the kingdom let's put a little context and return to Morocco that's it and today it looks more like this so how did the Cherifian kingdom manage to rise to the top of African economic powers in just years without oil or gas or very mineral resources lucrative well it's true that it mines phosphate but that's clearly not what made the country so rich it's not as lucrative as oil don't forget to like the video and subscribe if
it is not done yet it supports the channel and helps us to be better seen by the youtube algorithm let's return to our video morocco has a thousand-year-old history but for our subject of the day we are going to take a big leap in history until this year will mark the accession to throne of king mohammed vi and the entry of the kingdom into the modern air when the young sovereign accedes to the throne the country is as one would say a little crystallized the reign of the great king hassan ii was marked by a context so
ciopolitical to its tense but hey the world was different at that time and the kingdom was not an exception in this area especially the country was still torn between tradition and modernity in therefore king mohamed g reforms which will radically change the face of the kingdom the reforms social the new king will start by tackling the problems linked to the condition of women he will increase their freedom finished the era when the woman had to stay at home to take care of the children fi
nies the bullying and above all more work for her the emancipated and active Moroccan woman will quite naturally be more involved in the economic development of the country it also improves the family code and allows the growth of an almost free press the shortcomings of the kingdom are therefore laid bare by everyone  we talk about it and we propose solutions  a dynamic is created  the country slowly begins to move towards progress  infrastructure after the social aspect  the king will
  tackling infrastructure the kingdom is getting under way pharaonic projects are being launched everywhere road highway railway electricity supplies Morocco is transforming at high speed and the positive effects do not take long to be felt Moroccans are moving more often and more easily traders have an easier time transporting their products across the country economic centers are being created the economy is becoming more dynamic the kingdom is also increasing considerably
its electricity production no more neglect all urban centers will be completely electrified most rural areas also the kingdom will notably invest massively in renewable energies with these mega solar power plants in the south Morocco has also owned for a long time the largest solar power plant in the world Besides  is this not always the case today  tell me in the comments if Morocco still has the largest power plant in the world or not  I don’t
am no longer certain this abundant electricity will naturally accelerate the industrialization of the kingdom large factories will come out of the ground and increase the country's productivity and boost its exports the country is also investing in high-speed internet access as well as high-quality telephone networks throughout the national territory and served by the g then g network as well as fiber optics morocco will also modernize its health system and its education system in our
new universities are built and the old ones are modernized health centers to international standards are also emerging from the ground economic reforms king mohammed vi will start by opening the kingdom to the market economy given its abundant electricity and then its high quality mobile and internet networks as well as its geographical proximity to europe  morocco will quickly become a destination of choice for european companies wishingnt relocate their pr
production in meetings this is how the kingdom will become a leader in offshore services such as call centers textile factories high-tech services and even insurance the king will also create special economic zones that will boost the kingdom's economy and allow new businesses to flourish economic poles it will also make reforms in the agricultural field which will allow Morocco to considerably increase its production of citrus fruits of essential oils and other
 agricultural products of all kinds intended for export morocco will become the main supplier of citrus fruits to the european union and thereby achieve its food autonomy moroccans then eat hungry and produce the majority of what they consume the reforms will also affect the banking sector and the modernization of large Moroccan banks will emerge during this period such as the attijariwafa bank bank of africa group formerly bmce and many others all these changes v
have considerably increased the gdp of the country and the standard of living of moroccans the pivot towards africa before morocco was not always in good health with its african brothers the country rather oriented its policy towards the middle east and the mediterranean but king mohammed vi having understood that the future was rather played out in africa will initiate a strong return of morocco in african affairs he will start by reintegrating the african union that his father had left and embarking on the con
quest for market share on the continent he is going to warm up his relations with nigeria with which he is also building a huge pipeline which will transport gas to the kingdom and set up the subsidiaries of his banks in most of the French-speaking countries of africa the national operator morocco telecom will also launch an assault on the african market under the name mouf africa it is notably present in gabon  togo and the ivory coast all these reforms have enabled morocco to reach a level of development
development which has nothing to envy to certain developed countries its economy is working well it has all the infrastructure it needs airports among the best in the world motorways and even a tgv the kingdom is today at the dawn of even greater development the future will tell us what it we are coming to the end of our video is there another country you would like us to talk about don't hesitate to mention it in the comments and we will make a video of it don't forget to like and subscribe p

  hello everyone and welcome to the economic emergency in recent weeks the world has moved more than usual between the naval blockade imposed by russia on ukraine in the black sea and which risks causing a non-volley in international wheat prices and the news concerning the northern route promoted by russia but also by china it is time today to talk about it in detail and to see to what extent it is likely to impact the world economy as much as the market economy
ocaine to do this we are pleased to welcome sir madebroui hello hello thank you for having accepted again you have become a regular of an economic emergency past for the happiness of the spectators and another and I remind you that you are an expert in cpls chain and if you want to detail more a little bit more about your career path for auditors so I was I held logistics manager positions I started at the very bottom of the ladder I started like at tech so I
 started as a team leader in logistics and then I progressed to become a logistics manager in essentially automotive aeronautic environments and then my last position as an industrialist  let's say  was a position of manager responsible for forecasting and demand so that's where I started to take an interest in foresight or forecasting in macroeconomics because you are inside a market and what is happening at a few ends of the planet
impact your business so you had to be interested in these very macroeconomic things which ultimately when you actually go down the funnel end up having impacts in your business every day so that's how I arrived on this subject there and then after I I entered the world of idiotseil and then since then I have been a consultant for various French companies essentially so let's start with the naval blockade then following an attack with the use of a drone
 naval by Ukraine which would be of British manufacture even if still in debate on this against a bridge in Crimea Russia has decided to withdraw from the grain agreement or which allowed the cargo ship of different countries under different flags to collect Ukrainian wheat in the port of design and to deliver it across the world today a naval blockade with a threat to destroy to consider any ship regardless of flag as a hostile ship yes can possibly transport
he wines destined for the army of Ukraine yes so some are starting to talk about the risk of global famine of millions of people who would find nothing to eat what are we really talking about and that we get a little out of these fantasies there so I'm just going to leave your initial hypothesis is to say that it was following the attack that the Russians withdrew from the wheat agreement in fact the attack took place because very probably the Russians were going to withdraw from the agreement
 on wheat for a very simple reason is that in the initial agreement the Russians are authorized the Ukrainians to sell their wheat and in return the Westerners had to reintegrate the Russian agricultural bank into the swift system which they never did what they refused to do who have never done so they are not respected in brackets their part of the contract and therefore the Russians seriously threatened to withdraw from this agreement there the other point is that between that and the pancar I
uis at km therefore a passable for a drone so the military experts say that it is very likely that this drone left a grain ship precisely which was militarized for the blow for for to make this strike and therefore it becomes quite legitimate military that's why that now the Russians are saying that any grain ship considered as a military target because drones can come out of it that will go to hit Sebastopol or on the cash bridge or other
and so that's just to really rebuild things because even russia for a long time complaining for a long time that it's closed are not respected in the grain agreement altogether and there he ended up missing the fact that she had to withdraw she is ready to come back okay if ever again the commitments of the western world so that's the first part so he withdraws because the deal was not respected and what bothered them to sell their wheat
to them because in order for countries to be able to pay what they owe russia they need the swift system so it was preventing russia from selling freely without seeming so so if we care about the shortage of wheat in the world we should care the fact that the russians are able to also sell their wheat given that in parentheses they are just the first producer of therefore for the bad faith of the western discourse maintaining the real weight of ukraine since the week
last ukraine and the only one is exclusive producer of wheat in the world we learn all this by saying that we are all going to starve because the ukraines can no longer sell their wheat more seriously it appears that the season has been good in several producing countries the canada even china has had good good yields so very often we forget that among the largest wheat producers in the world apart from russia also since colin like china we often forget them we
thinks it's only their west and canada ah no no there are a lot of countries there is not a very big wheat producer so a priori there is production the fact of subtracting ukraine from world production should obviously have an impact because that these are relatively tense walkers but to say that people will start to starve in the street that this is surely abused or exaggerated how to canvass reacts to the level of futures contracts it is wheat
 so on the spot market there was a rise and on a day-to-day basis this is where we measure exactly the reaction of the markets on the long term the contracts are rather fine absolutely on the spot market I believeis that there was an increase on the day of the announcement or things like that then it quickly fell back on things that we know so there was no panic at the level of the markets if Ukraine does not manage to export its wheat through Odessa and all French people will not succeed
not because the Russians have broken everything there is nothing more that could perhaps be bombed there they have they have destroyed all the installations so like that there are no more discussions and if a ship ventures into the Black Sea claiming who will deliver the wheat it immediately becomes allouche because there is no installation to accommodate it if it is there it is there for something else they still cannot send by land to romania or to poland where i
he can take a boat except that it creates problems for the Romans and the Poles because it collapses the wheat prices for them  moreover they are unhappy with the sale of cranial wheat in European countries because it rivalries with the so Suddenly the Russians are doing what they know how to do best  which is to say a blow of failure so they prevent the Ukrainians from having their main cash inflows which they have left is the milk and they embarrass the Europeans for each other v
I think about others because well they will be forced to go through land routes to sell their wheat which will seriously annoy their neighbors so it's fair game I want to say it's war so this kind of attacks on people in then when we hear certain African countries which bought wheat from Ukraine even if in reality contrary to official speeches the majority of the Ukrainian wheat which was exported did not go to Africa it was more
early towards the developed countries but they say then we hear russia which tells us that it is capable of replacing the Ukrainian baby but we do not want promises we want actions is it essential savings is the reintegration of a Russian bank which is specialized in agriculture with the swift system or are there even currently means independently of the swift to deliver to be paid otherwise then the Russians can always if we want we can always find in a soil
ution to get paid one way or the other poutine talked about booklet quantities for free he can they can afford it russia is a country that is extremely rich contrary to what they try to make us believe that it is a country that lives in the last century of italian spanish gdp in these totally fallacious ways or totally crazy devaluation it is totally wrong because if we have we introduce purchasing power parity parity we arrive in the netherlands so not the
russia is a country that is rich and moreover when the war started the russians were sitting on billions of surpluses lying around in the european and american central banks there are not many countries that claim to be rich today that can claim the same thing so it's a country half that was placed abroad and it's a country that rich because it stings something to sell it's commodities in the world russia that is to say that there
 there is not a raw material or almost that the russians do not produce a sale not so it is a big store there i remind you that until now despite the war and everything to supply the american nuclear power plants and well they buy enriched uranium from russia everything until today they are delivered uranium rosatum and excluded from any absolutely any sanction even in europe because they are unavoidable one of the reasons why the russians continue to
to see chips good already because they have produced contrary to what they say they then produce them up to nanometers I believe but also they have a monopoly on the rare gases which make it possible to produce the chips so we can hold on by the goatee for a long time you see what I mean we can say in Russian we are not going to deliver the chips to you they will tell you that they are not going to gas and then we can look at each other like that for a long time so he always finds holes always deals
so here it is to say that Russia is a country which is rich and has the means tooffer wheat if you have to if you have to offer it well I don't imagine that he can offer all their production because now but here they will always find ways if they have to find ways hopefully hoping in one way or another but the simplest for everyone if we cares about family in the world is to allow russians to sell wheat i think food matters
s must not be militarized etc then there is another aspect of Morocco so Morocco has had the intelligence in recent years to diversify the sources of wheat supply so a priori there is no risk of being affected by the withdrawal of Ukraine from the world market of wheat last year finally as during certain years and then there is a super projection as you say in Morocco I believe that we are talking about fires in the major producing countries no here we are in canada and
tc completely I believe that the production in Morocco and I speak under the resin more or less it is not very good and the yield it is not good structurally since we already cover barely a little less than half we must ferréal more widely forgiveness not only wheat and then yes this year it is not good particularly not good it was not good last year I believe that Morocco has concluded a deal with India which had made an embargo on its sales of wheat
é outside except for morocco they made an exception for morocco or maybe for others but i know they made an exception for morocco certainly because there was a phosphate deal against him this year i don't know what's going on having like like deal me for me the real problem is that it is still not normal for a country like morocco there are ambitions of morocco to still not be able to solve a problem of food self-sufficiency in russia before the
The sanctions at the beginning of the years have been net importers in food since the sanctions they have become net exporters even for wheat  the world's leading one of today  we are all satisfied with these seeming when there is a will  a real will  we find solutions especially since there is no lack of land there is no lack of real intelligent modernization targeted and accompanied by the sector because indeed we cannot force an agricultural producer to make alo wheat
rs that it is not profitable compared to the yields of the competing countries girland russia china after the problem is not there the problem is what it needs to have an interesting profitability and to be able to compete so that it is the problem of the subsidies which poses the problem problem of profitability you know the Europeans the Americans the subsidies of the culture what makes that a quintal of wheat which is produced in the depths of France and cheaper than such a wheat which
is produced in the depths of Morocco it is not at all competitive if there was not the European and American experience on the other side absolutely therefore the subsidies distort the market a little that being said it is a question it is a strategic question which existential to our subsidized also our I want to say you have to have the will to do it the means to do it too but before doing it because that that if we consider that these strategies we accept to wipe the loss so
 that is the first point for me the second point for me there is also a certain moment we have to do our copernican revolution on our food uses is wheat the best cereal for a country like morocco in terror we should no more looking at sorghum or thousand  which are much less water than consuming wheat  which was mainly brought by Westerners  we continue to grow corn in this country even though it is a
plant from the southern hemisphere so in fact it is it is in full bloom in the middle of summer so it consumes a lot of water has nothing to do we have the least here so there are also these questions there that we must ask ourselves and that that necessarily requires work by the public authorities who must intervene on this and then also our agricultural techniques I'm sorry we still have techniques at school that which dates which dates from the French whatsay of their departure
t we have not modernized when we look at the yields per quintal in Morocco and the yield per quintal in Europe and especially in France which I know well we are practically half so there are strategic people who do not only integrate the profitability dimension but the food dimension aiming strategic so now talking about the northern route so everyone is talking about the new silk road etc what about the northern route which should make it possible to bypass
iterate a little all the oceans which are objects of Anglo-American hegemony etc so the northern route is intended as you say to broker the American navy which controls who controls the seas of the world and who controls the straits if we want to send goods  for example since we are going to talk about the oil that leaves the persian gulf to arrive in china you are obliged to cross the strait of malacca the strait of malaka at the same time against the by the americans and therefore at any import
what time finally it also passes in the south of india here is therefore if the chinese I do a little too much with the indians the indians cut the tap can order hostage the chinese energy supply absolutely he is chinese can not do anything about it because they do not have the ability to project themselves that far because contrary to American myths the Chinese navy is a navy not a navy of other mothers or littoral it is a defensive littoral navy so they have no
he so-called blue water navy they have no deployable navy on the high seas there is an aircraft carrier that they bought from russia which dates from the soviet era they were modernizing but hey we are not moving a hegemony with an aircraft carrier so not at all and with the advent of hypersonic missiles laptops have become obsolete when you have them which will be sunk by a missile of the people who will record the death of the aircraft carriers but for me they are already outdated so they have
 they have this fragility vis-à-vis india they have this fragility vis-à-vis the americans who controlled malacca rights so they have to find an alternative that's why they created the silk roads we say america is a maritime power much less terrestrial and so suddenly passing by the lands we will be a little less bothered by the Americans in fact understood on this the Russians arrived with their concepts of route from the north that is to say today the route
e from the north it's not the north pole that the russian people actually north it's in fact the essential deposits are in yamal today so it's and so we're talking about yamal we go along the russian coast and then we land we land on the chinese gates shanghai the advantage of this route is that it is a third cheaper than finally if you do saint petersburg and you go up by the northern route and you arrive in shanghai you are a third shorter completely expensive than if you go through saintp
etersburg the baltic the mediterranean so there is a real economic interest i continue to say that there is no economic interest for a road like that for the transport of oil and gas because these things are transported better and cheaper via gas pipelines of course it takes time to produce them to manufacture to put them in place while waiting for this road is an alternative not for the Chinese and then the advantage is that most of the journey goes through the others
s Russian territorial which is not the case of the silk road which passes through different countries in some may be the object are already instabilities finally we have seen with burma compared to the southern route but the same with kazakhstan we have seen the revolts who had a year and a half ago I think two years ago so let's say it's more reliable to continue on the hotels quite a lot of insolation the same country rather than going through country you are at doorman to wear behind thierry so the
with simple guns the russians can cause you a lot of problems and god knows that the russians have guns so it's the first to remove guns from the world they can put some so they can perfectly ready protect their their road their road the chinese too because that go from video to stock you are in chinese hotels so theset perfectly defensible for both it is far from seeing the Americans can always try a blow here and there but it is already
more complicated for them they make nuclear ice embers which is not necessarily I'm talking about the Americans quite they don't have brigades but they can do it I thought or submarine can drag their submarine and do damage if they want but we will be that's it  it's like their street which was exploded by divers who accused a trawler with sailors and that's it  they blew it up with a firecracker bought in the area so
American day who did the job ah yes but it is controversial conspiracy theorists agree becomes terrorist absolutely that's how careers are made quickly too so here is the road to the north that's essentially that today the interest the interest also for the Chinese is that isaac them Chinese ensure their supply of hydrocarbons today the Chinese are at the largest raw materials store in the world which is the street so once they have built the g
az ouducs or even we continue with the northern route will continue to transport ore because there is bad there is not only oil a whole quantity of ores there is everything that is needed so China a priori there will be no problem neither access to cheap energy or raw materials this is already the case now since there are two hydrocarbon markets on a global scale there is a market at preferential prices it is he who reads russia to india and china which buys depth but
oi and then the rest of the world who buys it at the market price yes dollars so already there is a differential which benefits in terms of competitiveness to the chinese and indian economy completely if you are that if you are on long term contracts yes then I learned yesterday or the day before I think that's it the prices of Russian crude have exceeded the ceiling that had set the Europeans because there is there is a need the Chinese are making big stimulus plans and so there the economy
  Chinese accounts subsidies is restarting in which pull the market is obviously tense it should be known that the cost of production of Russian oil is from to dollars it is the two countries which have the lowest cost of production per barrel in the world it is the Russians and the Saudis we are between and dollars the cost of production so even with a cap of dollars it is an average because indeed there are certain regions of Russia it can cost dollars others less expensive
but the average is dollars is what we say as a reference for for the for the for the for the russian crude and in the budget it is dollars in dollars everything goes in the receipts absolutely so when they sell to they are still they are still making a lot of money so we are witnessing  as you say  in fact  a split in the world you have the lasie india the bloc a china all that which will have access to cheap cheap energy almost unlimited and almost unlimited because we have no idea of ​​the ten
due to russian reserves and even don't know it and then russian oil was dug out anyhow at the time of stalin and still work to be done on this side there then the terrain is vast and on the other side there is europe europe united states the united states are sitting on their own reserve at least for the years to come so there is no question for the moment the danon of the farce and europe it is the europeans who are cut off from cheap energy who have nuc alternatives
léaire who no longer have nuclear power and then they will teach others a lesson because it consumes coal  which is what they did in south africa which was a real scandal but it doesn't matter so there is europe which no longer has access to energy not expensive and which at the same time it costs works the most expensive in the world so the economic equation in europe is starting to become very very very complicated and in this scheme Morocco cannot take advantage of it by presenting itself as a credit alternative
ible in particular I am thinking of the Nigeria Atlantic chart which runs along the entire West African coast and which crosses all of Moroccan territory him sarah Moroccan and which would make it possible to deliver gasified gas I do not throw away you gml yes me if I were the Europeansns I will find that it is a very good initiative and I will hasten to invest in it and move the project forward so far I do not see any particular movement or at least nothing to announce or do you know on the European side what is on it?
its strange so they are trying to make sure that algeria can deliver a little more gas than it can but algeria is already on the decline of its reserves and at the same time it is one of the countries with the highest population growth on the continent it there are practically more than a million Algerians per year with a demographic band that is contrary to all the demographic transition schemes with a quantity that goes back completely and moreover that has partly lost its credibility
 in the arm wrestling he had started with spain which made it difficult to sell the language afterwards when we turned out to be an unreliable partner who is capable of taking a hostage energy delivery today they have no choice so they are forced to deal with the no choice but the problem is that the Algerians have less and less gas to sell the real problem because more than or soon a little more of their production and consume
r by the internal market precisely because of this demographic growth and this need for energy well the buddies the Europeans offered them a somewhat strange market by telling them we will help you to make the sun so you will consume solar energy and not us gas because we know better than you what to do with it so I don't know if the Algerians have accepted this contract but hey I don't know anything but here is what they have as an alternative they have they have they o
nt algeria libya which for the moment does not really draw on its resources because the problems we are experiencing in libya the mediterranean quite greece still gasomics which pass through turkey yes that the ukrainians elsewhere are trying to sabotage its beauty so the situation is still tense and and if I was indeed in Europe I would try to ensure that the Nigeria Morocco gas pipeline moves forward and moves forward very very very quickly because nothing that
can the Europeans do to solve their energy problems will not be able to be put in place before the next few years in fact it is they will have very complicated paths we will not have but for the moment I do not talk about it I do not know or maybe they think I know no I think it was a Qatari or Emirati minister who said the other day as soon as the Europeans are going to have to become friends again with the Russians because it's basically they have no choice if they want energy all the time
 done unless the united states as it may be planned decides to recover the german industry by telling them bah the embarrassment the more expensive couple came to the children they are already doing it it is then we go the time the famous patriotact so who patriotism I I can't remember the name of the law but there was a word patriot which means that we grant more subsidies than electric vehicles which are produced on American soil so that's forcing all the actors
s from electric vehicles to relocate to locate trump I believe no no they also make foot calls to many German industrialists who can no longer operate with the energy costs that we have today in europe strange thing that I find strange is that france should have been the first country to benefit from it france continues to produce electricity which is relatively cheap thanks to the nuclear power plant it is gradually losing because it
has aged there is no investment in it some have even been closed I would like to see ecological but if the problem was tackled head on the power station which has just been closed may be they have everything they need and they would have been able to dump by saying the kilowatt hour it is cheaper than at home you cross the kidney and then there is also there is also German immigration which is in the process of being done towards Spain and Portugal because the
spain and portugal are outside the european market and that spain has been a big hydrocarbon hub for a very long time and it is a countrywhich has its own degradation facilities all that is needed so therefore we also see a certain migration towards spain okay even if spain has the same problem as everywhere else it is the tension on human resources but here we are therefore effectively the americans are in stripping europe of these industrial gems so
 I don't know how the Europeans are going to settle this  we won't necessarily see how it started  so now there are the bricks that are being presented more and more as a credible alternative  the collective antioxidant  that is to say  including the European market as much and all the structures that go with it and there is even a queue a lot of countries that want to join it goes from mexico to algeria which even wanted to buy its ticket we thought it was tickets for sale
ndre then do you think it's credible as an alternative heterogeneity it depends why making the bricks today is above all a kind of economic union his club an economic club in fact it started a bit like that who want to defend their interests a little visàvis a collective West who tries to do everything so that these countries do not replace them at the head of the global economic food ladder today they have the bank the investment bank of the b
risks it is today it is a bank which on paper is promising but which in fact only finances projects which are done inside the countries of the brix this is perhaps why they want to return them these people the countries which are anyone the imf has such a bad reputation of being an organization that only sinks the countries or helps them that we try to find alternatives where we can finance ourselves without necessarily having to break everything that may be the reason why these
country there try to enter into this form of to access funding that is not ideologized that's it and which does not give lessons without interference and which gives who does not give the lesson there is also on the side of the bricks the will to escape from a control what can the united states have on on a lot of things starting today when you make a move with swift the cia right away traces all all all all the exchanges you necessarily go through the dollar and like the united states o
nt had the annoying tendency in recent years to project their rights where the dollar is used the extraterritoriality of American law quite from the moment of dollar that is used so you were always at risk of finding yourself in conflict with American justice and each time you are in conflict with American justice  you don't have to look long to find out who the loser is in general  it's you  absolutely  so let's talk about the dollar because we're talking about alternating
tive credible what is happening at the level because some people talk about dollarization started by the bricks and it is true exaggerated surely true yes in fact we just have to put things in their place there are two parts there is the economic part there is the military component  if I may say so  the economic component  in fact  these countries no longer wish to use dollars for the reasons we have mentioned  therefore  the excerpt from American law and the fact that they no longer want to be danons of the
a joke if I may say that is to say no longer wants to be the financier of the american deficit the americans print money make the deficit a premium of the dollar and as everyone needs dollars everyone buys their their money but in fact by buying their money by taking their money in return for their deficit you finance their deficit therefore the regime also in finance also because bah as they have the imperial power to be able to print to infinity in finance effect
I want to rejuvenate them and that joins the military part of the discussion is that what the Russians and the Chinese are also trying to do is to prevent the Americans from being able to print ad infinitum to finance their military budget which is colossal for the information of viewers the American budget military is greater than the sum of all the military budgets of the whole earth so if he had to finance it with real money he couldn't or the country would collapse p
because the economy does notur would not finance a budget so what I think that the Chinese the Americans are trying to do is to bring all this back to concrete by ensuring that the United States begins to bear the consequences of money printing which is not supported today is the others who support it for them so how they plan to go about it they share their inflation with us completely with the whole planet yes pools it and their mutual deficits
so what they want to do the Chinese the Russians are two things to break the link between the dollar and energy yes so the oil dollar that calls into question the value of the dollar as a currency necessary for everyone and to back it gradually as the currencies then by gold where you are compared then or you can no longer print infinitely because you decline you automatically degrade the value of your currency and therefore if you have the choice between two currencies one
in the only value it is the face value and paper on which it is printed and the other is its equivalent in the north naturally the choice is made you take the one which is based on gold because it is more guaranteed for you so that's it those are the two the two things that the Russians and the Chinese are trying to do via the bricks with regard to the dollar but contrary to what I hear very often it does not seek to replace the dollar as a currency of exchange
s universal I can say because it could not and the quantity today of art it is the most liquid asset in the world but it harmony that we will have the monetary mass in dollars the colossal you can move billions of dollars in a second the price of the dollar does not move you don't do that with any other currency  you see it right away so it won't be replaced right away  but here we are  we're trying to bring American power back to its real level.
 what it should have if it managed its economy like this like any reasonable state so it is true means and not fictitious by the printing of the dollar and therefore from this point of view if I understand correctly in fact China does not want to profoundly cause the collapse of the United States nor the economy American but dollars of dollars of dollars of the world do not want to lose the billions I believe of dollars in the form of reserves and in front of the treasury and therefore what China wants is rather a multi member
tipolar we contract a little American hegemony to bring it back to a primordial and first power but not the only power they actually want that I am going to say the same thing as you but differently what they want is that the competition is oneself and that the best wins okay hello monopoly but you don't play with the bank that's it the bank takes note that's it and the Americans don't want to go there because they don't have the means if we had to confron
ter the two economies facing each other would not have not had the means it's the Chinese well they have their problems in particular demographic very serious demographic problem which will surely not overcome or he must find the way of the legacy decades of totally crazy policy completely when he pays the price today so the but when we look I didn't believe for very long the announced Chinese who were starting to approach ban on microprocessors for
 Chinese also not very long ago and were starting to approach dynamometers they are in the process of catching up with the gap so until they industrialize it will take a while but at least in the laboratories they are there is a faster way to recover Taiwan but what you have the technology but hey when they are maybe not to bombard them trying to do that it is precisely it is all this masquerade around Taiwan finally there are two problems with the masquerade I am making a
he little digression regarding Taiwan it's a sm what's the name of the founder tsmc so it was smc which is the real problem one of the real problems if tomorrow you are smc leaves taiwan I can tell you that the Americans want to take Taiwan you take it elsewhere which legally is theirs yes even the by the united states by the united states recognize that taiwan and china so there is a discourses a bit schizophrenic around taiwan misinformation times no attempt when o
n trying to pretend that taiwan is another country no the problem is that in fact taiwan is china china is china except that the taiwans think that they are the real china the chinese people think that they are the real china so he is there the problem and the other problem also that there is around taiwan is the crossing of the strait of the passage between taiwan and china of the three dormeous so the crossing of this strait what international law says is that the straits are
free unless the two deaf the two coasts of one of the three are in the same country but a bit like turkey with here it is so if tomorrow everyone agrees to say and we settle we say that it is taiwan and china the passage through those of the three there Chinese monopoly it's a Chinese monopoly and we should pay Chinese rights to pass what the Americans obviously don't want to do because for it to be so therefore there is Taiwan it's we're going to look for a problem for finally
n it's a it's a problem we expect the solution a solution of a problem rather even moreover so therefore there is a schizophrenia on it but hey here are the chips he can solve the problem by taking by taking taiwan but but hey they are in the process of make up for the delay the high speed manage to have the plans of the machines which are produced only by the Dutch there an sms which is a Dutch company which which the only manufacturer of the machines which allow f
area of ​​engravings at very low nanometers nanometers there was also there the Americans prohibited this company there from selling machines to the Chinese and then strangely a few months later there were plants these machines there which got lost in the photocopiers that have been forgotten in one in one on a public bench you know people of somewhat surprising things that can happen and the Chinese recover plants from these machines so on the boat we are going to do a little
 reverse engineering trial and error and then be able to reproduce so overall if I had to summarize the other Moroccan point of view we have no real reason to worry about a medium term neither in relation to Ukrainian wheat nor in relation to the dollar choose a medium term in a horizon years because Morocco also holds reserves in dollars and euros and at the energy level that is another aspect we did not have time to discuss it in detail but overall here is Morocco in
end europe has every interest in promoting the nigeria morocco project which would allow morocco to access energy autonomy through gas in particular and for gas and europe also by accessing gas literally not because liquid form that it is after to regalify for what do i have absolutely for me the real concern finally there may be several but one that I see is what should worry morocco today its first customer is europe and europe is in such a
very difficult economic death so when your first customer can no longer afford to buy your products from you or less than before or the markets are going to get complicated you have a problem afterwards listen we can not decree real times it is only since until very recently his majesty the king made several visits to india in china in russia signed in-depth strategic partnerships each time accompanied by businessmen etc. afterwards it was up to the private sector to do the job I mean the
 diplomacy and politics have paved the way established the legal after that it is a problem of mentality question of ease of comfort we rather go towards the market that we know rather ah maybe there has to be a difficulty in europe for moroccan capital there is no choice but to go to china than to go to russia than to go to these countries there good luck that he goes a little to africa but we can indeed still diversify our markets on a global scale
you're right on that it's the more private market that has to adapt and the private market what will make it adapt is the markets and it listens to financing that's what moves the the the the market so if it sees that their market is contracting on the side European or that their outlets close iwe will have to look elsewhere  they will not find much way to orient themselves elsewhere which is not the case for example of the Turks who do not wait for that imad for the conquests to walk elsewhere I have
aggressive the Turks are very aggressive in addition the devolorization of their currency creates a lot of problems for them but gives them advantages you buy me I see more and more in Europe Turkish machines Turkish-made machines already household appliances which have a marker of global technological catch-up they do everything today there are teletures which have Turkish air conditioners there are ovens there is almost everything and they are hyper competitive because of that they are people
who work very very hard it's very difficult to do business with them it's because we want to do business with Turks but they are serious people so they have the future for them in addition if the Ukrainians don't damage their language of the duke today found sitting on energy literally so Turkey theoretically if they don't do too much stupidity they are part of the g or the g in front of whom it is the same for us soon soon to conclude with a
other optimism very good but at the beginning yes thank you very much thank you it's insight and this intellectual freshness that we don't find all the time and I also thank all the people who followed us and see you as usual next week for a new episode
  hello everyone and welcome to Morocco project we are delighted to meet you today July to share with you first-hand economic information our topic today revolves around a discreet but powerful entity the Israeli maritime company says mintegrate shipping service want a trip to Morocco book your ferry now on Morocco boat ticket easy  fast and reliable also known as zim this company sails on the zo
Moroccan nes since but with the normalization of relations between Morocco and Israel at the end and the recent recognition of Morocco of the Sahara by Israel Zim suddenly positions itself as a potentially essential player in Israeli trade with Africa since Morocco in fact Morocco is actively preparing to the effective implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area the CAF and it seems that the stars are aligning for ZIM according to experts using the ma
roc like zim platform could extend its reach to sub-saharan africa via the port of akla atlantic more immediate opportunities are envisaged one of the most salient examples and the transport of locp fertilizers to africa which currently reaches approximately containers per year and this rate is expected to increase tenfold here to reach the annual containers founded in and side to the new york stock exchange since it has an impressive fleet of ships and it operates in
 close to its country in Morocco  Zimm is particularly active in the transport of household appliances  tiles and ceramics from Turkey and pasta to the United States. In short  the evolution of Zimm's presence in Morocco could have major implications for the economy. of the country positioning it as an essential logistics hub in trade in Israel and Africa thank you for watching this video if you enjoy our content don't forget to

  good evening everyone welcome to the guest of the editorial staff of mehdi tv rise in the prices of raw materials due to economic and geopolitical upheavals in the world historic drought in Morocco with significant repercussions on the agricultural campaign in general and cereals in particular in the rotations ne according to forecasts should not exceed millions of quintals compared to millions on average in previous years and growth forecasts at the base
even if the central bank on a relative attenuation of inflation and a slight acceleration of economic activity despite a stability of public finances the social impact of the economic conjunction in Morocco remains very significant inflation os the unemployment rate and inequalities according torecent data from the h add to this a low inclusion of young people and women whose labor market and the absence of a dynamic tpme fabric are all factors that have led
to a stagnation a slowdown in economic activity to take into account this delicate and uncertain situation that Morocco is going through and analyze the economic policies deployed to renounce growth we are pleased to receive today youssef guerraoui filali president of the Moroccan center for governance and management thank you a lot to have accepted our invitation it's me so inflation it's been months since the word every mouthful and is felt in all
 moroccan scholarships but lately we are also starting to hear about stagnation what socio-economic phenomenon we see this word then stagnation is a very special phenomenon in morocco for this year and it is a very special phenomenon that we have not observed in morocco since the adjustment plan structural of then stackflation simply means what to clarify our dear citizens quite simply we are in front of an economic decline it means to slow down
weaving of economic activity the consequently a rise in the unemployment rate parallel to a continuous rise in prices where there is a certain inflationary pressure on households on the Moroccan entrepreneurial fabric versus obviously a slowdown in activities and economic sectors which are in suffering and that can be justified by several factors including the devastating effects of covid the russian ukrainian conflict and other elements so you do when you
did you say the parallel you compare what we live today with the time of the past years ago can we qualify because it is not the same situation what brings this current conjunction closer to that of years ago and what is different then to qualify the era of the past was marked quite simply by the staging of international organizations so global today morocco it operates in full sovereignty we are in an economy more or less which is
t liberal with some state intervention as a welfare state like the government the kingdom of Morocco but of course the situation is obviously explained by internal effects possibly others which are external yes the external effects we have known about them for months we have been hearing about imported inflation but unfortunately given the high structural prices given the continuity of that inflation is no longer imported today we are obviously observing each other
an inflation that affects several products several Moroccan foods of Moroccan production and we are faced with an inflationary state of mind yes in some way if you allow certain resellers certain speculators are there to raise prices because there is the general feeling so precisely and also perhaps that the time of the past there was more visibility because today it is a world precisely a certain change of total practice and in addition to that is that there is a
n lack of visibility okay and we are in an economy where there is a certain insertion and it is linked to several factors not only imported inflation not only obviously the unethical operations of resale of speculation or increase in justified first names where we seek in to inflate the profitable markets  but there are other internal factors  in particular the shortage of water  yes  the problem of drought  climate change  so many problems  of course.
n obviously who explains that the change in this phenomenon of stagnation that we absolutely experience then this conjunction of sophonomics is difficult to start of course you said with the pandemic and one of your analyzes of which you put forward the figure of millions of Moroccans who would have swung into precariousness and you say it is the equivalent of years of hindsight in terms of the effort to fight against poverty in Morocco which is enormous and there too makes the middle class grumble
 to a new category that we also didn't know and that we're starting to call a class  we're from that average  in your opinion  is it a short-term impact or is this impact what we're experiencing pshould it become endemic and settle down over time because people say to themselves is it going to end will prices go down? I know that no one has the answer because we don't have control over many elements but it has been going on for a while when even exactly absolutely l
The general feeling and good stomach in my opinion between now and the end of the year we will continue to live in this inflationary pressure so already in the short term we are part of the effect of inflation and in relation to stagflation and therefore unfortunately today it is instilled in the Moroccan economy because that the number of business faces has increased the suffering entrepreneurial fabric we also unfortunately observe the increase in the cost of living for the middle class which is impacted
Obviously therefore the entrepreneurial fabric as I explained and therefore this inflationary pressure will continue until December so if we want to push the analysis a little bit I think that we have to wait at least two years to be able to decide whether inflation will not will not go towards the medium term or not but for this year the effect is there the situation with two obviously modest actions undertaken by the government I do not think that this pressure in
paversible inflationary will fall or disappear the few months to come then the rise in food prices and caused in a first lion we separate it the rise in import tariffs but you also have the disruption of global markets changes in value chains but there is also  you spoke about it  opportunism  speculation and this effect of panic and there are many who benefit from it so the departments concerned in your opinion deploy atil
 enough effort to fight against these behaviors which could provide a little relief to citizens there are a lot of announcement effects but beyond the announcement effects do you see that concretely there are things that are being undertaken we had seen things that were being undertaken  excuse me me during the month of Ramadan and then absolutely then the actions which were carried out by the executive power by the government were actions a little bit to reassure reassure obviously
mment the citizen and obviously reassure the market in general so it is true that there were some subsidies to the transporter there were field trips to try to carry out checks but it affected the retail trade so it is not the seller or the final reseller who will obviously act on the sales prices because the problem is a problem of source we are in front of a value chain where there is the main seller where there is lagr
i a farmer who delivers a certain price after with the effects of resale of speculation the prices increase with very high steps and then the final sale price it is very high myself in all sincerity I had made the remark to some members of the government to tell him for tell them that the actions which were carried out previously were not actions which were targeted because even the one which was connected to the transporter it was not the taxi drivers the transporters of
 goods which were targeted were the people who had the approvals possibly instead of the control centers so the control must be carried out on the content it is a quality control which will have to operate on the products on what we consume but the problem of the resale of speculations this is a problem there is the source so we must see the determination of the cost price the initial selling price the resale at how much the final selling price with what percentage of m
arge that's where it's going we're going to have to hope for a return of the markets and things that haven't been done and that's what explains the rise in prices today just allow us of course as I'm making raids we continue we work with the self-employed resellers we are we are in contact but with details we of traders the prices for example of certain fruits and vegetables they fell the previous week and they start to rise again when we take tomatoes p
ar example if only to give a very simple example it was one that we leaveto so there is a problem of resale of speculation and I think that is where he will do we will have to tackle the real problem this is where we must tighten the controls we must obviously carry out actions which go so well the determination of the cost price determination good we understand when we import the non-phosphate fertilizers that are used that it is completely normal it will
have to pass on the cost price but for the other foods there is little purely agricultural production which does not require materials that are imported we have to act we have to fix the prices we have to control we have to harden obviously it is also psychological and it's good of course ma'am that's why I spoke at the beginning of a state of mind that's inflation so it's the feeling of inflation have integrated them we are increasing the price because we are seeing increases on the right and on the left
 of prices yes and that that's very bad for the citizen exactly so to some complex external internet environment that has been talked about it's transplant recently according to the statements recent statements of michael's rent so frankly the only site of what could become a banking crisis in the united states and paradigm shifts related to digital transformation geopolitical fragmentation as well as the rise of yes economic sovereignty and climate requirements
matic how this new paradigm can they have a greater impact on the Moroccan socio-economic situation sincerely when we already see the measure that has been taken by the bank we have acted on the key rate and these are things that have been done by several foreign countries especially when we see in the United States in america but the impact was was an impact of what would i say an opposite impact even in morocco today when this measure did not reduce inflation the price rise continues we have
increased interest rates and believe me I know entrepreneurs who tell me that we have to go through credit regardless of the interest rate because we have problems that are put to working capital financing so we also have that does not limited demand on small businesses that need financing yes and inflationary pressure it continues precisely concerning businesses of course the increase in the key rate it has led to the automatic increase
e from the rates of the banks to the tightening of the conditions the small swords tpe and have suffered a lot but the big companies the gme are doing well absolutely they even have they are even making profits but it has a cost absolutely so already if you allow me I start by micro-businesses then micro-businesses smes today are really in a situation of suffering we are talking about business opportunities we are talking about failure until judicial liquidation the reasons are various from the reasons by
 the past  such as payment terms that are too long days days it's not normal problem of penetration into the public procurement market orders that come from the public and private sectors  even in the context of public-private partnerships the triple ps we do not favor small businesses the very small business adds to this the cherishing of the prices of materials and supplies and entrepreneurs told me clearly today we buy materials and supplies with an increase.
n which varies the to and that impacts the cost price and it seeks to maintain the selling price and therefore they lower their margin they lower their profits which once again impact their cash flow effectively there is also a blow for the big ones business resources they continue their development they even have double-digit growth but they are very vigilant it's a pact human capital recruitment promotions salaries no change of position
 fewer job openings we are seeing in the job market on one and we are in the process of reviewing operating expenses and logistical expenses where we are sort of giving a breath of fresh air or very small business to obviously be able to play the role as a fairly average supplier to large companies  so we talked about the agricultural season and the cereal harvest  which we hit on half of what was achieved in the yearsprevious millions instead of
e million we will of course have to import wheat already that we took before and it is derived how this will impact the Moroccan trade balance what it will further widen the structural deficit completely if you allow me well before the covid I had participated in a program if I remember very well there was with me the union representative of agricultural activities and I made the remark to him today we have a problem of self-satisfaction which concerns
  basic necessities how come an agricultural product like morocco does not manage to make satisfaction in terms of wheat it is elementary it is essential it is true that all countries in the world even emerging countries highly developed countries matter but one carries materials that are not part of the essential culture of the country so we bring wheat we bring in euros it costs too much and therefore it is a pact directly the balance of trade so we are
 on a widening of the trade balance deficit which is structured even worse this year because with the effects of inflation with the rise in prices we will continue to widen the trade deficit badly than the performances which are achieved in terms of exports  in particular exports phosphate and even in the automotive industry so we will once again have an impact on imports by these it will get worse it will be fine next season because the dams are here it is
point on which I wanted to bounce on top of that the problem of climate change the decline in precipitation and today we are experiencing a serious problem the shortage of water yes we are going what is happening in other cities of the kingdom so really a problem of water and even the projects desalination of sea water we have not yet reached the pace the speed with a guest in addition it is expensive and it is expensive and it is quite voluntary investment so sorry now for the
 economic policies that are deployed by the government what is the government doing to renounce the economy in the short and medium term do the initiatives of the government do they fit in because it does not seem that I am asking the question whose spirit of the new project of development models Morocco  which we hear more about  especially when we see that these policies and the government's forecasts are often out of step with the projections themselves.
e of these specialized companies like hp or the bank of morocco queen what about these initiatives unfortunately i have the impression that the moroccan government has drowned in its crisis issues  in particular the problem of inflation the disruption of world markets following the russian ukrainian conflicts and finds their justification in these elements the development model today nobody talks about it anymore neither parliament nor government nor public institutions hepatic
onomic and it is very unfortunate because we have prepared a whole roadmap and we have planned to make Morocco emerge on the horizon that it has unfortunately become today to read feasible in terms of government action when we see the projects that have been carried out to date today in room for that these are projects with a lot of remarks with a lot of shortcomings when we take for example the problem at wrach we are faced with a temporary job it will create a whole problem
thematic because it's temporary employment we're in the process of doing some sort of entry into the national these are workers these are workers these are people of course who have passed in the footsteps of graduates we are stopping these are people who are in a precarious situation we are in the process of employing them temporarily afterwards we may run into other problems obviously of reintegrating these people into the labor market the problem forced him into the center we
 receives a lot of remarks of complaints from startups project leaders other entrepreneurs it's too long it's too long the incubation after you're asked to file and you'll go back to presenting yourself in front of a bank branch it's as if you want to get the terra after if there is a previous check without provisionwe are late in payment etc you are not going to have financing it is so long and that means that it takes months months sometimes a year yes po
ur to have a financing of dirhams which will not allow you to launch your project today with the effects of the inflation of very important we have very little time left why I have the impression that it is a taboo we do not speak much about revision of the tax system why the class average is taxed very heavily and that the wealthy classes are not enough could we not resort to this as other countries do that the wealthiest pay more taxes and then we
 lowering the taxation of the middle classes can that be a solution and of course among the recommendations that we liked in the center we are still obviously talking about this tax pressure where we are on a rate yesterday which is quite high and possibly a consumption vat who has so this is what this is about there have to be initiatives there have to be courageous decisions that have to be taken by the government to act on this water if o
n lowers yesterday's rate by two points certainly it will improve the purchasing power of the citizens of the citizens since  failing to increase wages exactly  so we will act the opposite and give a certain breath of fresh air to these people if we lower the vat rates for basic necessities we reduce there would be a positive impact this is important and we were talking there has to be a courageous tax reform where there would be innovation why this is
to say we are going to pass so much reluctance why reluctance for tax reforms but precisely there was the tax base a few years ago there were a certain number of recommendations but since then there is not this audacity to go ahead and say that we need to create this wealth tax it was even mentioned in parliament we need to introduce this and the wealthy people the richest people must show solidarity they must pay more taxes must contribute by
r is it with these recipes or the state in a way he will have a certain margin to help help obviously since a last question observer economist and then president of the center for governance management are there other levers that you propose to give up of course the economy protect purchasing power and preserve macroeconomic balances for me the main lever and the promotion of entrepreneurship in Morocco but this promotion should not delay
even more than that quite simply there must be an opening of the markets the markets must be opened up encourage entrepreneurship small very small businesses they have a problem with their order book they do not easily accept the public market and act and act truly and practically speaking on payment terms we don't get paid after two or three months it poses a problem the word passes quickly and a working capital of recurring expenses
entes and small entrepreneurs must honor the commitment end of the month thank you very much youssef I remind you that you are president of the Moroccan center for governance and management thank you sir thank you madam sir thank you very much for following us good continuation of the programs on media tv very nice evening
applause so we had the pleasure of launching today at the mi level the agency that deals with the energy efficiency of our country and the economy and the green economy we had the pleasure of launching the oire therefore have a bank of projects of to achieve projects in the green economy and which is piloted by the agency with this specific station so as to be able to give to all those who want to invest in this sector of the green economy firstly project projects
s and secondly  end-to-end support this is a first we have done this in a certain number of sectors lamy wanted to set up this history room and this project bank and they did a remarkable job i invite you to take an interest in it the world economy is in the process of moving towards the green economy so these are future projects that make recycling or optimization at the fairand energy consumption or energy production there is a whole spectrum
 which may interest everyone I invite you to look at these projects very closely because the agency has set up a certain number of partners who allow it to carry out its projects in the best conditions you may not have the opportunity every day to find a bank of projects already ready and people at your disposal to support you in carrying them out so once again I invite you to look at these projects very closely and I congratulate the people who have t
worked on this bank of projects it's wow this method of operation is now the market way of operating for the entire department and all the agencies which depend on it and the results are quite impressive we are very happy with these results so I invite you once again look very closely thank you
this program is presented to you by theme wilcom it the participatory window of tom wilcom began during the month of November his regional tour in favor of participatory partner banks naturally the economic capital constituted the first stage of a campaign and national communication aimed at presenting to the national banking network the product offering from Tom Wilcom's participatory window the finance teams we weekly took the opportunity to speak with
ec abdelaziz deputy general manager of tim builcom responsible for the participatory window of ahmed samui who shed more light on the range of products we have two flagship products we have in mondayne and in my group the companies with a turnover exceeding millions of dirham or the amount of financing contracted is greater than in dirhams the other product in the same bad thing it the companies in the turnover do not exceed in di
rhams and who contracts a financing which does not exceed one million diran we have another co-financing product which is called witnesses which is intended for the northern region occurs there it allows to co-finance with the banks and participative windows the project leaders in its region here the novelty in relation to this product is that we suddenly move on from the project of dirhams that is very important the particularity also which is very interesting is the rate of march the rate of my
rge applied for the part of the background and for the urban area and for the rural area then for for individuals we also have a moment moreover as we have two products which are necessary to keep petty and fogological targets the Moroccan population has irregular income modest for foggans and targets Moroccans living abroad and the middle class in a way for the activity of the participatory window of Ahmed Samui with a development plan is part of
a good dynamic and should progress over the years to come the year has had good momentum because we have our activity in dammarie in it was the first file that we guaranteed it was in July and therefore it was also a year of start-up but also we still consider ourselves in the start-up period but we have nevertheless noticed that most of the banks and windows use our products and I believe that in the following years it will be fine.
nt experience more success and production it is assigned that according to bank maribel financing granted by participatory banks has increased year-on-year by around billion dirham in order to October if your missions were presented to you by samuel com
well hello everyone I hope you are doing very well my name is Mourad yours I am responsible for international strategies and partnerships within Casablanca Finance City Authority and we are delighted to welcome you in large numbers today for this new webinar I would first like to thank all the quality speakers who honor us with their presence for this event a big thank you bank in châu com formerly known as the central guarantee fund
  mo sanders from liars place by ton factory and last but not least the startup criterium as you may know this webinar is part of a yearly calendarpictures of africa innovation lab quickly a few words about innovating this is an initiative led by casablanca finance city the region presented this patch is there to unite the various stakeholders of the tech innovation finance ecosystems around issues related to digital transformation
 of our financial industry the prohibition also to support the emergence of cleantech startups in Morocco initially and then eventually on the African continent and the theme chosen to be events this time is that of the financing of startups a tooth and freedom to share with you a certain trend some key figures from inside the field in connection with the issues the opportunities but also and above all the challenges to be met in terms of financing startups to
 at the national level we will also try as much as possible to precisely put this rock panorama into perspective with what is happening on our continent is largely international to set the scene remains without too much effort and the subject which is I am convinced will be treated in a quite exhaustive by the other round table I would like to share with you first of all some elements of context in the first point the craze for African startups is confirmed from year to year in and
according to cgs for example startup weekend have managed to raise funding to put things in perspective it is six times more than in for example and if we refer for example the bomb and gabri father grids and fundraising on the continent of passes in them billions of dollars so it is a symbolic bar which will undoubtedly be crossed by the end of the year certainly if we put into perspective the orders of magnitude compared to the us for china and their men the amount can seem
modest but clearly there is an extract in fundraising in africa will exceed the levels of sales combined it's just impressive maybe we should see an impact a bus to learn denis which greatly catalyzes the digital transformation on the continent and has enabled a better hatching and a this rapid symposium of sons share on the continent a second point looking more granularly mania the origin of the funds remarks quite contritely
area of ​​growing interest from investment funds and international weavers especially this year this coming from the us and china in fact clearly to africa is in the process of goal is on the radar by investors is a certain phenomenon of geographical diversification designates flows in the beyond the classical  mainly European liquidity hens  this is a good thing which will undoubtedly make it possible in the long term to accumulate more capital and above all
 to put them in competition third point it is a trend that we observe in this is that of the return of the best financing weapons and the extracted pacifiers are multiplying during the day the proliferation of the number of unicorns as photoways loud and clear yes we have only woven a few chelseas I the hope will indeed have a ripple effect on the respective ecosystems and will come to support the virtuous dynamics of development carried by networks of business angels inner demons the fourth
 point this being said I will have just noted strong disparities which already undergoes on a geographical scale since we are witnessing a certain concentration we could qualify from its podiums in fact the top in and nigeria kenya eligible to attract two thirds of funding lucid according to partech question the strategy south africa the top but not far from the workforce then beyond the geographical scale part there is a sectoral phenomenon certain verticals have the wind in their sails c
as the company noted that in passing its share of the lion's share of financing in africa and also the tv schedule that the snow which falls well while in the segment are more behind finally a third underpinning would be the villa differential sport and diversity in terms of fang is fundraising in africa remains essentially of the order of their district roughly in series and is very good for series this bias as a benchmark in the us for example naturally have the ecos
system is much more mature the proportions are quitebalanced in the site in presenting around it would go to the adventures of it is a sport and therefore we all who are clearly less like in terms of financing this laptop on the continent to this bodes well for the annals that being said the image remains in the process of building contrasts depending on the geographies of business niches and other stages of financing vehicles and in line with our panelists at
will really have the opportunity to shed more light on the subject and worked through their turn their perspectives and their feedback from the field we will have a very test light before giving the floor to do swore history which will take care of other whales moderation I take this opportunity to wish you and your loved ones happy holidays by wishing you to acquire exchanged looking forward to seeing you again his good health in for other innovation cancellation events
thank you thank you very much here we see it indeed so a mobile home in the investment which is which is really current thank you for all the figures and therefore we are not at all in this top in the furniture far but removed it with the opposition nevertheless a dynamic which is quite positive at the moment and which was therefore launched by the tables ci by private institutions so we will start anyway with tamoil like other ccg teachings with dr it's v
rai that the state had already tried a mechanism a little in this direction to make subsidies in the past but for a few years therefore the program innovatia and innovate it has come to be launched through in particular incubators that you have labeled so since you have funded hundreds of start-ups through grants but also honorary loans could you tell you a little more about the impact it has had on the ecosystem in particular and what are the resources?
Finally  the results that you have been able to see and what are also the future prospects for for its programs thank you this curve for de gaulle is so hello to all we are really delighted to be present with me today in this webinar so just a little reminder precisely in relation to what was said today about the transformation of the public limited company so just as a reminder today the company has given way to the guarantee company and this national guarantee company
ntie of business financing therefore the gfr scene which today is structuring a public limited company and which has the brand name as therefore today telecom has inherited the entire project offer of the ccg and today offers guaranteed interventions for financing and intervention occupants equity also then on the activities of innovation in fact we set up the fund in and which allowed the deployment of an offer dedicated to ostie that to the support of the project leaders and
 innovative companies to this fund innovest is structured in two major interventions in the form of equity investment intervention by which we call structure and three investment funds which are now operational and which are in the investment phase we also have the component said financing and these are two components that have been set up and deployed in partnership with active players in the ecosystem  these are
s incubators of business accelerator clusters and it is through this partnership the municipality deploys finance of financing instruments in the form of grants and loans of honor so until today after four years of activity a little more than four years of activity euphoria novès has already been able to its part on the investment part finally make investments on with investment tickets totaling more than million dirhams and on the financing part
we already have commitments of more than millions of dirhams on more startups so today already at the end of these two it's more years of existence we have noticed that nothing is apart  although by parties if I can afford a job just by its amounts in the commitment clock which has finally which has evolved from double to triple from year to year that it has already demonstrated that today there is a certain dynamic which has been qui was created a craze in the creation of start
up and that too was felt on the ecosystem because we are also delighted to see that several other players are starting to support innovation today and that suddenly today it encourages and writes and who actually does if you want there are several initiatives that are today in progress but my games but in fact if I can allow a lot of things for others to build we have start-ups that drink days we have innovations that have brought clear ideas today on the m
ark of several actors today are beginning to follow this incentive to position themselves to propose initiatives to support entrepreneurship and innovation so I think that there are many things to build but on the one hand what has already been done what is being done today that this whether on financing or support initiatives  I think we already have a lot to offer entrepreneurs and I think he will give it back to us  well  I completely agree
today the first reflexes for the start-ups which are launching and which have also made it possible to help on all that is death valley the famous valley which cubes a lot of start-ups so starting another mechanism also during the launch of start-ups and use business angels so concretely we don't necessarily have those reflexes there because we don't know who we were talking to today we are not with us but says who precisely launched the start up factory a network of businesses
s angels in the africa and which comes to complete then but tell yourself you work with my books in particular because you are tired of the relays of the wilco program and I imagine that you indeed confirm all the precise points of the barbed wire but I thank you moreover for the figures I was not necessarily aware of defending investment I saw millions of dirhams for start ups it actually gives us an average of millions per startups which is very interesting and suddenly if
we had to move on to everything that is business angels but said today to just for africa can you tell us more who actually makes up this network of business angels with whom you invest yourselves why the African vocation hello everyone thank you very much this and it is for this beautiful invitation i am delighted to be part of this panel so maybe before by the currencies it freezes i would just like to confirm something which is very very important which precisely what lives
nt to say minimum through jean will come it is thanks to the fact that this life in a jacket program that the star ecosystem is not really started today it is start up with there is a commitment of subsidies which can be up to two hundred thousand dirhams or loans of honor which can go up to a thousand dirhams where before the truth it was really the desert at least today we have entrepreneurs a little more experienced who can take I would say more risks and come to undertake
end you have to remember at the holidays the start up is not the student who leaves university necessarily the start up is I would say here it is three people who have a little experience who have identified a real problem and who are trying to solve it and global global problem and which can be fixed in time so I take this opportunity to thank yes when in relation to this program I will never say it enough without this program I am sure that here in terms of fundraising we will be
it not the e but maybe the e finally outside of africa that is to say that even if there is no andy country so therefore it is an important point then indeed in the financing value chain there is perhaps even before the ccg what is called love man and it's having saved enough money borrowing money from friends' family via after special week man and immediately after the good saint john part so indeed we are giving a we launched a network called hands
 up for africa which has a goal which is very simple it is how to have it within reach of the smart capital of which a little bit of money is not as much as baldness and at the same time to carry have made the mans campaign of quality by people of the investors who are interested because they have put money in and have a great eexperience and who can open doors and provide support the principle of edge for africa is very simple first of all to the fact of all the members of these r
networks there are successful entrepreneurs who years of experience who have lived this business is Thursday the obstacle course of entrepreneurs and who want both to make a difference but also to generate income in a different way by investing and recovering a multiple by the following evening with children at libé or even a little later so in this case try to do before building this network there is that we did a small design phase typical of creating at the end
I'm business angels but also with I would say start-ups he tried to bring up everything that worked and everything that didn't work and what the start-up often told us I'm afraid to associate with mogi because someone who has money who is going to hand over the money and at the same time I'm afraid he's starting to make decisions for me and that I was able to say for a moment so we actually tried to come up with a solution or there people in fact they are as I said they e
n having experience who will return at the level of capital very very low level the minority trade it can be simple maximum that's it a little bit the orders of magnitude they can bring between five hundred thousand and one million dirhams never a business angel will go alone it is generally who will come together to treat you and bring this diversity of pets and starters and he is actually helped in I would say in a passive way in his management is sure
re so today we are more or less investor members it really has what it has in a very very organic way we find at the fld and Moroccan entrepreneurs who have succeeded others from the diaspora foreigners entrepreneurs also from the continent who have joined the group and we find start-ups in the form of roque elle but also Senegalese tulle côte d'ivoire and also therefore from the continent I think that through a geographic region we must have already reached thirty exiles because it
 was done so it was very very timid at the start because good at the same time start ups look at the investors opinions have to look at the start ups and nobody dared to take the first step and it was really accelerated thanks to the program which aired on m who is going to invest in my project it can happen that moment the switzerland that we had found we had found my friend of investors and start ups on him in the same room in front of cameras gina moïsan invested and it started
ché precisely there the dynamic is today we are seeing more and more I would say of two deals to be made a confidence which settles I would also say a governance which is set up the Moroccan model is very different from the model of nigeria or the kenya but we had to find our own model so finally things fell into place  that is to say that the world of networking needs to multiply more and that we are more and more investments but and
I was still proud and delighted with what business angels and these startups are doing today together and then her and the first success stories that are taking shape and start-ups that have already received money from the gel stadiums that have been able to the comics then defend that they have gone abroad and are in the process of developing so here is a little bit so this lack of budget you have to know in fact that it is a piece of the puzzle and naturally after the business angels and
 they are going to facilitate access to investment funds like that of pizza or like that of in fact it is a value chain there are different stages and business angels and all the same to enter it very important which were extremely weak a few years ago today and I think that there are four networks for those who love who will arrive soon so it is getting structured we can say that in Morocco we are more or less business angels and and it is in the process of being put in place and in my opinion the pr
first success stories those that will give langli the ability to multiply his career and that's how we can create an ecosystem system is good over time is a value chain or each time there isan actor who invests who can reap his stake and have a system business model and beautiful both for start-ups but also for business thank you many people say so in fact and suddenly we are old enough in the ecosystem to know that there were kisses and wise
of the sale but who did not have sufficient education so who who who who was perhaps a little greedy in terms of valuation and who took big seems what was not at all in the investment game on you at this stage today so the deal is what that you can tell us a little yielded average ticket this is how much I think we may have lost but what happened so to tell me enough this is the average for an equity which will go from to me sometimes we will go up to
but with larger amounts and even much larger commitments apart from flying faces  you also don't see a business angel as someone who has provided capital and leaves with it is not something motivating so it is better not to relaunch investments than having someone who has the meaning of a box and in fact it decribilizes any approach describe it a starter sadek reveal the business angel there is no work that will be relaunched
raised I think that the ondines are its th business angels manage to have the sector and who put enough money to achieve the objectives I think that the relationship can be excellent and in fact regenerate the most important added value in this type of date it is necessary that everyone is sufficiently motivated to be motivated but we of course remember that business does not only bring in money  it also brings in a network of contacts in fact brings in contacts for approach
r defends like that of dacs like that of youssef which will have a credibility that thank you very much in fact for the portage added that these sails and business angel go too and the annals well negotiated the important points you do well to specify it and moreover how we just contacted you and just for africa if someone is interested and it's super simple by the way on the website and geographical to others that there is a form you just have to fill it out with someone of the same
ipe contacts the person within hours to help them first cautiously to finalize their pitch idec organized for them in the month a first session in front of investors and then there is a whole bunch I would say a governance which has installed that I can perhaps no time to detail here but in any case it's very quick and it's very pragmatic and factual perfect everything is on the site in any case if we need to contact you on the site thank you very much tell me
Listen  you clearly specify these value chains  we actually start with she will come which will give enough in the first grant to launch a small people and to validate the idea a little then we actually have access to business angels today through your network or other networks and since May we have also had nine in dos santos which was launched so it is one for which were launched we have today two with us so we are going to start therefore dha
bitude it's an honor to women but we're going to start sir here are back landers so you are you have launched in and you have been very ambitious finally I want that I don't see you well I see you but suddenly there was indeed an ambition to discuss a bit of this model of life if by coming with all the practical beasts that you have studied abroad there you are in the fourth match so suddenly there is feedback what can you tell us more in particular about the deal fl
ow when you came for the first match what was it like how did the meeting go with this deal flow were you pleasantly surprised was there any education on their brothers or even only in thank you very much and I bounce back who said mehdi and Malian they refer to each other which is very important which is the Moroccan model so indeed the success of an ecosystem would only be achieved if we really find what we adapt all the models that exist to the context my
rocain so indeed the part at the museum are even if I'm going to come back you tensed me a person told met we will come back it is indeed it is for the Moroccan model to benevolence is an integral part of this model of success but rome to come back a little bit on the figures and on belgian francs have created in launched in by cdg invest which is the investment branch of the cdg and we really had the ambition to come and say to each other there is indeed something going on in this
ns the ecosystem to start ups on the other hand we see that there are not enough leaks in the transmission belt so who has all the work of the team of william which is being done to make entrepreneurs want to launch the range of epi they are and they will be accompanied by structures such as the strack the start up factory and other structures labeled ccg and afterwards in fact there is a void and immediately afterwards we find ourselves with with structures and fo
nds who are going to come and who are going to put some type is in the order of satisfied even sometimes even millions sustainable is therefore really mapping the ecosystem we realized that there was a hole and when you talk about the valley of death I actually allow myself to to use this term there because indeed the valley of death is mainly where we are between the end of the president and the beginning of the series at we are really in an abyss we are not tall enough to be sp
ots and to exploit by the great vices there is we are we do not have enough skele to be able to continue to strap you waters continue to ask to go to new to have other other business angels and so that's where we decided to position ourselves in posters life is to say that we already have the company going and we are going to be in side and in series at and so there we decided we structured the program to be able to raise tickets between three tickets between one and three million dirhams for u
n for a stake in the amount of on average and after in series to become and to continue it is investment and to add millions of additional dirhams it is always in one in a fundraiser now what is important to know and how you are doing well specify its tarpaulin we still have a little feedback we have already supported more than fifty of that and we have invested in more than twelve start-ups and we have deployed a little more than millions of
dirhams whether it is in series side to there is we will say maybe that two thirds in syria has loosened a which are in the process of closing success stories which are being finalized and we are really extremely proud to see that we have had this structuring impact on the ecosystem now to come back to a weight that is extremely important we are not talking only about money and fundraising what is important is to find a Moroccan model it in the Moroccan model the thing that
there is the most value is the support part and so that's why only in time than in us as a program as the vix if we are structured around baigts so an incubation badge that will last six months and a tarpaulin of acceleration which can last up to months and therefore during this match to the trend is in cuba are there we get to know the know the challenges of start-ups we get to know even the founders and we build very humble
nt but together we actually build the milk delivered we try to solve the real challenges that the company had before entering the match to also have some figures in terms of selection we receive almost impossible in application to select between one and a half and so generally it's the badges that are between and but the advantage of this match is that the first months the program it's free so it's absolutely it's not paying at all and the two
th point is that all the start-ups that are in this game are not in competition so if in a perfect world where we had the some they are all invested sand but I was ticked on the on the m start-up is really for for finally because good i think there is still a lot more to say by kenza and by tell me the point that you quoted sade it's the investment fund part is really venture capital the venture capital part so the partbecome
 and to have an approach of saying to ourselves we are going to take a risk and when we talk about risks that means as much as there is a risk of losing our stake and therefore of actually losing the ticket  that is what is important  what we have done it's that we tried to copy what is best in the world and therefore to bring back concepts a little bit to this time the dsr or like the start up it is enough it is not yet big enough to have solids and to be able to come and valo
raise the company what we say is that we agree on this antique and we agree on the participation we agree on a four-step valuation and we tell him Vasy starts to work and it's step by step that's when we arrive at the series at there is an annuity which is in a hurry it is at this moment that we reconvert our our ticket by looking in the nominal dad to really enter into the qualities parts but the main thing here is to say to ourselves that we have brought back a be
st practice which did not yet exist on the market which I trust you I give you millions of dirhams use it to deploy this capital and after once there is a series to which it is pressed we will be able at that moment to convert our dear ones and it doing everything is done with real kindness and that's what we always say having in fact everything is certainly a little undecided it's that a fine and where we only have your capital and therefore suddenly all the creation of value is done by taste
 and all the governance is done by you and therefore it is extremely important to also have this awareness to say to ourselves we are going to stop saying that Moroccan startups must be assisted absolutely they must be accompanied because we have sufficient maxim of both expertise and a well-shaped head to actually be able to create companies that will really flourish at the national  regional and global level  excellent thank you very much  I am also on the twelve sta
rt up I bounce back a little I take advantage of the opportunity to have with us to have heats have a little behind the scenes little on the twelve stars such as you had there were also mon series which were lifted so I know about some but there are some had quite a bit and you are lacking the op it will also put itself at this level absolutely so indeed not for the moment we are in the process of finalizing to be able to effectively round off because once again it is at the discretion of the sta
rt up but the idea if what I would actually like to keep is that our ambition is to create role models and not to say that it only works in other countries or in geographies or access to financing where there are ideas which are very easier now which is extremely important and thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to say this is that indeed to be able to raise a series we saw that there was a fear that was taking hold and it is that the Moroccan market
in there are some verticals where the Moroccan market is deep enough to be able to focus mainly on this market but but the idea to hope for what it is to be able to raise funds is that we must quickly internationalize and the goal here is to be able to create and use Morocco as a poor concept a bad test and if we see enough traction to be able to quickly and in a very cost effective way that of being able to go skiing and therefore the majority of start-ups which have
 lifted and they are in the process of finalizing the lifting in series a are table stars who have succeeded in launching other countries and being able to ski abroad I actually particularly remember this last point has become internationalized you the market is international is starting to think big and you I stretched a magnificent transition to pass unfairly accused thanks for everything for points is indeed see big and from the big hatchery it is going towards Europe was going towards the workshops
from the senses towards Africa went towards Africa in the East in the Middle East in any case we made a proof of concept in Morocco and in value and in this aestheticization precisely in Africa the thabor we with our pizzas so clearly this match clashes so you have a strategy investment a little more global on the continent you are going to tell us a little more and the same is what youthem to share with the water certain cities that you did in the questions after and what are the learnings that
you had on those on the African markets in general thank you thank you thank you for the invitation that of the team it's thank you all for being there it's I think it's a great initiative to finally have the value chain of financing in Morocco brought together and I'm delighted in fact to see that there are more and more that different actors are positioning themselves on specific links of the value chain to fill the guys who there was that there still is always but where things are much better since
 a few years and so we actually come just after so there baptizes it initiative there and we come how much at the moment when the startup finally begins a product on the market with traction and begins its growth phase to help them precisely with what it is and on other markets then atlas ventures game I take this opportunity to remind or present the need therefore we are a formalism in Moroccan venture capital with an African strategy therefore we invest in four main markets
x Morocco Egypt Nigeria Kenya in companies which will digitalize key sectors of activity of the African economy and therefore particularly active in three key sectors they are there fintec logistics and supply chain and altec we have already made nine investments in these four industry insurance markets there and we are in the process of finalizing in culture and five others by the end of the year and therefore we will have a total portfolio of companies in our portfolio so to give you an idea of ​​an investment
i at this stage of pre series at then there youssef excuse me but I don't quibble about the permits it's just to align a little bit in relation to the audience as we are talking about the same thing in fact that in the now African standards the two sections are incredible come and an even more valuation in the round of table is therefore finally we which we consider as series it is rather rounds of table around millions of dollars and its setbacks which are already very well established
on the market who have perhaps already started the signaling good after that it's really working rather detail of round table of millions than what we do what you call for the series for us it's easier but therefore goes to say that we have invested in swiss id what I consider to be the stage or time all the more invested and intervenes and fundamental is crucial and which is today the shoe that hurts in countries in our ecosystem then the sign and the loan
era so we are rather focused on the site we sometimes do Christ and we also do not planned and so today we have cds round table which will be five hundred thousand dollars up to millions between and it is there sometimes millions this year we are starting to see the turning points of this size of a very serious year and therefore I give some examples of sartène in our portfolio to illustrate so we invested in boxes in the supply chain logistics sector in the r
eee pays in particular which are going to which are in the process of digitalizing and transforming the supply value chain of grocers so it is two-tube marketplace which will allow grocers to place orders on a mobile application and therefore to pass all the intermediaries in the absence of that of wholesalers and distributors he had this startup aggregates orders it receives from all these grocers and buys directly from the superiors at fmc g manufacturing and books in
 hours it's official so with ada not that they collect and are able to predict orders to buy really online and deliver with their own logistics precisely which optimizes and at lower cost and it's free for the grocer and therefore the udders if it allows us to never in lack of stocks and especially of power as he has a very limited BFR he cannot buy stock in sufficient quantity to be able to order gradually and especially with this date at the well there is
manages to score these grocers and therefore to allow them added financing therefore learning to be able to give them in order to be able to finance their working capital and to be able to buy goods on credit and pay later and therefore this is what allows these tests to be implementedbecause finally the grocer network and constitutes the volume of sale of fm if j in africa so it's a huge market and that's why now even by opportunity in this sector and has allowed officials or to get out of the mod
dolphin island of poverty we will say to be able to build businesses that are suspect and so that's where we have two months of startup there in fact we had three a fairy hitch elsewhere by one of the other companies introduction portfolio why didn't you do having it is an ecosystem where we make things easier but where they make the agreements that are traditionally made but of course you have a role in helping them shippers suddenly on the Moroccan market we are very happy
nt to see maxam quite precisely one of our perfect companies in egypt which makes this model there and which raised we invested others in the very first round and for the lost trophy puy civ price it had maybe three months of operations and today they raised at millions of dollars they are in the process of experts precisely on the moroccan market after the acquisition of rhuys anyway it was another of our portfolio companies that pivoted to make this model a and so we are very happy to see
r these events where these demonstrations of regional expansion and to play a role in that because I really think that's how we can build boxes that have a reach that can become winners in their category so that's an example in egypt we invested in the same the same business model in kenya in a box called soko h and which today also has what it is regionally and therefore throughout the district europe east africa therefore kenya uganda rwan
da and tanzania and therefore also are in strong growth and are they have exceeded the series we would advance something and therefore we have other other other clubs in the dance hector daqing tac so I must give you examples which are that I find very interesting because that these are models that we do not necessarily see in our ecosystems where the regulations are different and a little more complicated and therefore it is a box in nigeria called bamboo and which allows nigerians to inve
stir directly on the stock exchange in the united states and this from the mobile application which is connected to their bank account ni jeannin and therefore it is really the democratization of investment apart with minimal amounts so it is a bit like the robin wood that you know American success is therefore a bit like the African robin wood rhythm and therefore also experiencing phenomenal growth and are also in order to stall on other markets and short-term performance other regret to
what you can't give of course what you can't reveal obviously you gables in terms of performance which is rather satisfied so we give performance on the first point we are very happy we were impressed by the growth appeal in countries like egypt nigeria which are the African clubs but we are also very happy two is in hand and we see more and more beautiful clubs which are coming out and I come back to the point that some
 mentioned we need success stories we need re models to show that it is possible and from that moment there is a same this fall is today with just a few actors a few voices that are starting to stand out we are starting to see more in addition to investors who look who come to you to interest you in the market in the Moroccan market so we are we learn this case no doubt that in a few years not even in the following year between cases there will still be
more enthusiasm and we are already seeing a good growth in fundraising on the Moroccan ecosystem and I want to tell you that it is really the work of the whole ecosystem at each level of the value chain and perhaps we our role to complete this chain of value there is to be able to consult bridge between these ecosystems there and to be able to also have its networks with lives if African regional but also of the silicon valley and others who want to invest precisely at the stage
of maturity that we are waiting for and where we are playing two street corners is this trusted local player to allow them to raise their ratestable but also to help the Moroccan boxes to what it is in sub-Saharan Africa or in Egypt and vice versa and here are two weeks to come in Morocco listen thank you very much to me what I love about you like the panelists and that you give transitions all done then that we don't even know agreed the agreed who talked about success st
ory is beaten gave me the excellent transition to talk about a success story that's what I wish you another comedy with louise startup critérium which in any case is in the process of being well launched you had the chance to pass parish here so for those who do not know not here it's the biggest accelerator in the world and which has accelerated startups like airbnb or dropbox if you know them and well by him these startups there we are fresh behind so but say hello hello that's hello
our to you well listen congratulations already for all that you have accomplished so far we fundraising it's not it's getting famous but it's just the start of the job I imagine so but it must have been a job all the same to be able to gather a little funding there so you have read defends Morocco but also abroad can you share with us quickly this experience there and possibly if there were any what are the challenges you had as a sta
Moroccan rt up to raise funds from abroad stiggy honda is of course with several baths thank you for the invitation and thank you for defining us as a success story but I don't think it's good that we still trained it quite a bit access well so for the little story for retracing a little bit of history trails behind him so he is the founder marc and myself we created frédéric fin we started to work on the project and a few months after that we wanted to raise funds p
to give us the means to build a lifestyle that is signed by our first customers and unfortunately the others on the market at that time it was not very long ago but all the same for us it is as if it was an eternity ago was very limited it there were few investors and for those who were active he didn't really have a friendly approach for scared start-ups we'll say as you were saying earlier I'll write them down he was greedy we spoke to you at the ep
very low investment request for a stake in the measures and told us about blocking minority and many other modalities which had appalled us and therefore we decided not to raise with its actors and to hold on as long as possible and a few months after the panthers program was born and it was really the turning point for us it was the light at the end of the tunnel but really we had we had apprehensions as it was the program of an institute
major but we were more than pleasantly surprised both on the profiles of the team of quanders that they really knew what they were talking about and that they had worked really well before dancing the program approaching it the investment methods all that was really a breath of fresh air and and we said to ourselves not long ago very terium would not be what it is today without it so it's not because it happened there that I'm saying it but it's the reality and so then we worked
lived for a year being accompanied by and we had the chance to join must y combinator so it was not common way and gold it was the third time that we applied and so here we have to we have to persist and finally we were taken because we saw we had good traction and we were really delighted because as soon as we launched fresh land we set ourselves the objective of joining wa here it was the holy grail for us and so after oaï if we went to seek funds from vicier int
international and so it was very recent since we just graduated at the end of the road so it was three months ago and I was warned that saleh difficult but me here warned us that it was going to be difficult but it is but it is even more difficult than I imagined being a startup operating on the Moroccan or African market is an additional challenge since even at the international level there are not many funds that have the Moroccan or African market in their mandate there are more and more
us but there are not that manyand it's not easy to convince them but it's not impossible and so these last three months I have completely left the responsibility of criterium management to my partner romat and so that's why it's always good to be more than one not to be solo fender to have at least one co-founder because I was able to devote myself to this fundraising I was on a road show and therefore I pitched to give you an order of magnitude g pitch and more than a hundred lives
s if it was pitch per day for two months plus the due diligence that comes with it etc and but today it is possible to do it since we have almost closed and and therefore we should complete everything before the end of the year and disclose and all that is  I hope  shown to a few other start-ups in the ecosystem that it's feasible and so you managed to raise these times it was repatriated to Morocco where you had to create once again everything which is a Lausanne record I want to bother anyone t
you can tell me but if you want you could just education can you do it while being in Morocco or not then it's possible to do it while being in Morocco after so that the funds invest in the Moroccan structure it's a little bit more complicated since it's not that they don't trust Moroccan regulations or other it's really these funds have years of experience they've learned to navigate American regulations European regulations and so they go
 not for a startup will learn to know the Moroccan market Moroccan regulations and therefore it is easier for them to finally invest in the east in the United States or in Europe or elsewhere and therefore it would be an additional barrier an additional challenge than trying to convince them to invest in a Moroccan structure I understand perfectly and in any case thank you also for having made it clear that peach and doing a road show is really a full-time job so we can't
s managing his start up and was hoping to raise funds at the same time so that's where the co-founder and deferred carrying it's lausanne but it's hard yeah thanks anyway for the portage what it is I know a lot of entrepreneurs who have come have also come for listen to the story because its part  you have already managed to actually demystify certain aspects from a start-up point of view of course and that is very important so we can raise funds abroad there are solutions to
today and also not to finally give in to the check which is not ultimately which will not help and therefore you received offers but you preferred to hold on and so much the better but in the end you had other alternatives which were really more suitable so thank you very much I I keep you for a moment if you had to give advice to start-ups who listen to us and who would like to raise funds at what stage should do it and what should an investor look for then at what stage
l it actually depends on which god of the stadium finally if we seek to raise a specific ticket including a side ticket but it's always interesting to raise funds when we have a certain momentum so when we are at an inflection point and therefore that allows good to attract the disinvested then for your second question what should they be looking for if an investor so I always thought before joining king here that I needed a great investor who was going to invest in the right term q
ui was going but shifted to open doors who was going to think with me but what we see here told us is that an investor on yahoo has that is to say a good investor is an investor who gives you the money and who doesn't rant that they really let you work because we're pretty busy as a start up there's so much to do so there's a lot of investing who say to themselves I'm going to help you I'm with you I'm going to make intros etc but we don't have time for two
  years that I do this kind of investors or not well in fact it depends on the stadium we liked the cdg do not bother us and but he was there when we needed two and so that's what makes them available to them that they are not there at all time has asked us to give accounts or to make meetings or to make cones but when we need two they are there to reach out to help us as they canyes basically the start up must keep the power effectively and generally
t we say that the start up must raise when there is no need it is not always possible but it is true that this is the perfect ideal thank you very much in any case thank you for sharing so we are going to try to switch a little to questions that we received a small question in the background perhaps to people investors it's a bit the same question that I asked babi the same thing what do you keep at these start-ups a little cash what should you look for in an investor and you
what are you looking for in these startups the really in two three sentences and then we will move on to the cubs to youssef do you also want bobst understood perhaps on an important point of these inverses what the entrepreneurs looked for us perhaps an important advice of things that we see in the market is that first a certain finally this truce important to identify the problem the problem that must be solved and to have good value value proposals to solve it because
in fact the challenge is not that there is no money we know that in fact and then you need good entrepreneurs who will tackle the right market opportunities so with a large enough market and with a business model that will be ex callable so frankly the point to remember is really to tackle real problems with the issues on a large enough market and where there is a depth of market on the local market and if there is not there we must immediately think regional or continuous
nentales or elsewhere in any case where it works and if we waste too much time trying to build something where there is no real interest and August it will be the fundraising will be much more difficult so when investors see a good market opportunity with good entrepreneurs and good execution well there is in any case everything there is a match point on the side invest in agree with you kenza effective mask what is really important in the phase of
  pressing this is special and the founding team is an integral part of the product so we cannot yet dissociate the product alone from the team the team still is a component of the valley offers scale and therefore sometimes even if we have some doubts about the product the fact of having a superb team which will be resilient which will always be able to ask itself the right questions  clarified its operational model and always ask itself the right challenges are part of it bab makes positive points
  to take into consideration when we want to invest so that's a first point the second point I will never be able to have a French session but it's the depth of the market we have the impression that actually becoming and to say a market size which is a few million of dollars we have the impression that it is big enough to be able to attack it which is really important to keep in mind that if we want to leave Morocco do not create a success story section we must not
not at all afraid of big numbers and so we saw for example in the first match and a second match or excuse the father really said but we were fighting with the entrepreneurs to add in their business plan why to tell them but don't be afraid to think big don't be afraid to be able to attack markets where your problem is well identified and your solution will be able to be deployed there so there is that after what we were looking for what we were looking for
 advises what we could advise to entrepreneurs who are looking for financial partners is really to think a little more about smart money than just about lats monique so to be able to raise money I mean in a very pejorative way is very subjective yes money exists but is it that at a specific moment you only need money or you need money plus support so I don't really know the excuse for but in reality you really have to be
mature enough to understand what a start needs and how we will be able to build this idea this is this adventure in power at Lesc and the pitch years and abroad yes perhaps just to complete quickly compared to what entrepreneurs should look at and cheSearching for an investor is really this alignment of French values ​​only in this environment socially of vision of value and a real relationship because ultimately it becomes a partner
non-operational but it's still someone who goes all the way with you it's very important that he has real understanding and shared values ​​a real vision and you're not someone who's going to try to see accounts where to tell you men invade homos turnover us useful return on investment will be there to help you grow and really understand the mind of the start-up which first growth before profits and unfortunately many investors today
 still in Morocco other types of investors may not yet understand it and seek to have is it profitable right away rather than understanding the game which is really a bit of growth and market acquisitions to the death of monetizing so that's a question of mindset and perhaps on the moment when to get money well in fact we see a lot of entrepreneurs who sometimes try to raise funds without having started in the sense of having something for our vip and
 to something to show and it's very important to prove that you can execute and that you have a product on the market with one of the first customers who are willing to pay from there that's proof of the market so that's the scratchy bit of continuation which is really the irrefutable proof of your product answers m minutes time for me the palm of the moderator thank you just to specify traction is not necessarily turnover sometimes we agree sometimes it is also a traction
 which can be excluding turnover just to clarify because we actually had the question on board in the panel so if you have user traction or other that can also qualify you to raise funds in particular from two then only I belong the monetization part to the pricing part and is a project that is large enough and therefore the fact of already having clear signals of traction and usability are sufficiently relevant to be able to justify
er a fundraising and to be able to convince my breasts and the excellent investment funds then we are going to take some questions I would have had quite a bit we are going to try a little cleared up very practical questions already to believe concretely today therefore the new tmz com site to find the structures which will be labeled how can we contact these structures where can we find them what is the type then and usefully the site has been reviewed all of the
 contacts of the structures then I do it if I did not do it earlier we in network of these labeled structures the contacts are presented on the website and indeed I saw the question some of the structures distribute the subsidy an obadia and hino stark others do not that innovation depends on the stage of progress of the project etc. but in any case we are on structures which can distribute the ugly start the honorary loan is among us not bad we only expect the m
oitie who have already closed their matches we have three today which are being selected and therefore which are bought at prices of course all the contacts on this meaning on the website by the way thank you from the crier in fact not enough in the startups which have degrees the entry criterion already is innovation of course subsequently and the entrepreneur profile the scalability the potentillas level of the structures and of course it is enough just to come into contact with the structure it is possible to deposit
er the applications with the charge to the entrepreneur of choice to say that but who he subsequently wishes to continue the process and then there it is so it takes place in a press format at the end of the call for projects pre selection it is the mass extension of the jury and so there you have it after the processor and which were stopped but which is due if a startup target raises a big one making it done or which is too diluted already at the business angels stage can that pose a problem at the side and ser stage
ie to and if yes why how am I going to tell you that yes absolutely so indeed I think when we talk about the ecosystem and when we really talk about educating or creating to really stake outa real ecosystem is also to be able to integrate best practices and start to have women's rollers which are installed and therefore effectively on this part of dilution and of capturing good we realize as said earlier world me we are actually starting to have some after-effects drunk
siness angels united monopolize and very big very big not and only once but the entrepreneurs raise bearish bridges or unfounded cda it happens extremely diluted and as in fact we can take it as a rule is not a general rule which is not a scientific one but it is a rule of good practice which is in fact to arrive at keeping the absolute majority after the series so that is to say that because it is we remain in the majority to be able to continue to arrive at a certain
  governance and a certain vision is now what we can say hey hey hey what is it it still remains the negotiation if m five young people for example of the structure who voters and to be able to sell him the concept of arriving at the ciani a for example lava with water will perhaps be multiplied by or more so the fact of being able to reduce reduce by an accordion effect of being able to deduce its meaning in turn from its participation in order to be able to give enough
 freedom of oxygen at the next bottom is something that should be much more plausible to sell than saying we stay like that and we block the others lift and we block the blocks the best practice so yes indeed we start and there is in parentheses we start to have more and more entrepreneurs who are very  very aware of what is happening in the world and to say to themselves this is how much Mac Apple must be this is how much I want to dilute myself incident this is how much I say to myself
 is therefore indeed it is starting to come but if there are problems with business angels if he is really a jean we can actually discuss with him you must discuss with him you must explain that a capture wants them to be much more real that it is better to be able to raise fund by fire well it's very clear for today a little last question is that according to you there are some barriers that could exist in particular for all this
which is done in this start-up world and and what do you consider precisely so that as practical to remove these barriers there it is a bit of a question which is the cnsa perhaps you who were able to see a little of what was happening abroad a little comparison a little of what is happening abroad which perhaps makes it easier for us to invest a little and we cannot find it at home perhaps two points so there is the part of the financing between has remained until it is very risky and where it is
very difficult for private absaar and funds to deprive of taking the risk is therefore why actors like the ccg or to bring something fundamental to the ecosystem of to learn as an atheist its private public but that is one part but it's one more is needed I think but after the other thing it's a technical and legal question and I think that the entrepreneurs who have been there today understand why from the beginning so break their heads with
not or in any case we talk about it in the ecosystem because we also experienced it with our two thumbs and it is unfortunately the fact that it is a best practice in Africa and it is not that Morocco wants to specify it is that a good time to be able to raise funds with institutional investors of lives six international or in any case which invests in several markets it is necessary at a certain moment to be able to have a legal structure abroad and therefore in places in p
the business laces which are used for the rest in venture capital where all investors are used to investing and to the readers are standard and fast and therefore for once this is a prerequisite which today poses a problem in Morocco because you have to be able to create a company abroad requires a procedure to go through the exchange office to have an exemption and to be able to create this black box the voice of the company to the other the holding company abroad to welcome
ir investors today it is a trial which is still complex and ba lot of entrepreneurs a space I dare not do because it may be not raising enough funds there is not justified it takes a lot of time to learn and therefore this point there is something that should be facilitated by the government and therefore I think that public institutions are beginning to realize this and it will make fundraising much easier and we could have a lot more investment
urs who participate that it is Moroccan and a foreigner who begins to invest earlier and for example for us it is a brake to invest in Morocco before the way that they can be abroad it is very clear thank you very much is located allows it I could indeed add one point is to make the box really investable there is perhaps not that today's topic is mainly investments and fundraising and access to financing but for
ur being able to be investable  there is nothing that must absolutely not be omitted  it is the team and the quality of the teams and therefore  for example  a company that will do brains and that will do machine learning from and to equivalence and a saas service and which doesn't have a click who doesn't have a developer who doesn't have a site he can't come and pitch and sell investment funds by telling them this is what I'm going to do this is what I'm going to do and therefore indeed and there are things in progress
structural dairy core may have been put in place to be able to have more and more people and the tech and dave team is the second point it is indeed to talk about barriers also there are best practices that are in the world when we talk about stock options when we talk of an incentive and and this is where it is a concept which is so well deployed all over the world and which is not yet well which does not yet exist which do not exist at all in Morocco it is the fact of being able to
little by little interested but the members of the team to take ports to receive bad evenings from the actions and therefore to switch from a mindset which extremely powerful to say to oneself I am no longer employed I am I am a shareholder or there I am honor and therefore when we actually have this corn they are quantified mindset it's really it's the mountain and it's there we really shout super success stories so there are still structural things frozen in Morocco but I'm playing there we have
 very  very good signals with all the stakeholders who are really starting to respond present and want to take these feedbacks into consideration to move the barge towards an ecosystem which is much more stable and much more flowery charming people thank you very much but say as a start up to what you have one last point added in relation to that no i think i think that really everything has been said me i know the final word well in fact what said that helped us yucel
are very fair in relation to the tips which assures us that at a certain point the box must be fitted with a seat finally an international presence to be able to attract investors it's ok we realized this when we tried to raise funds from investors outsiders i think there are things that are being done and so the authorities have realized in any case that the actors the ecosystem sense coming from the account i think it's on the
good way and it will really allow to release the full entrepreneurial potential of Moroccans and and I am in relation to I told you the story when we started three years ago but today really it is the landscape and is completely different it may seem anecdotal but I have a lot of people around me who would never have started entrepreneurship and when we see everyone getting energized and binary seconds is part of the dynamic initiatives
which allows the ecosystem to move forward there are a lot of things happening and things are going in the right direction so that's it for the for the final word thank you what a final word thank you and I thank all the panelists frankly for your time for agreeing to play the game too and sharing a bit of information which was very interesting and you were also so you allowed us to keep the promise a bit to showa bit behind the scenes of this world
e the investment of financing subject thank you to all all the old audience who connected so we were more than a certain time so thank you all for having taken the time to come and listen to this webinar there were lots of questions that we could not answer but this will not be the last webinar on the subject they show things to say in the year will surely do others and we will have other types of content also on the subject in particular with each of you and it is to go more
in depth on what you do and suddenly I also just remind that therefore I am the coordinator of africa raised at the lab it is a bit our mission to federate a little it is ecosystems the phitek ecosystem in Morocco and we do it with all the actors who are present here and other sites that we could not have with us today and there will be other events of this type so stay connected with us if you have other questions I invite you or other information that you have
 need I invite you to connect with me so sure I will see so it's already this webinar will be recorded at the end we will put a small slide with all the information so that you can actually get in touch with us I thank all the panelists once again which is that they took their time a little reminder a last little reminder i received a question that we wanted details i remind the value chain very very quickly we have a dream will come it's for
r all that is subsidies at the beginning it goes up to thousand dirhams audacious loans of honor up to one thousand dirhams then we have a job for africa which is one of the bus networks of symbiosis which exists to be able to raise funds so in side as soon as you have done that as soon as you have an opinion that is viable you can go to panthers or out moreover what they are of deficit which exists once again on the place in Morocco and we have others of course and and at this time there you
go to two of the site and the loan if nothing is not like that and oscillates from ceria and then you can through its two networks go to financing which will come from abroad and for tickets because in more important and more interesting so thank you to all I say to you very quickly and very good evening and that's all thank you
hello to all and welcome in large format to your debate program on the in this issue we are going to talk about industry we are going to take stock of the current association of the industrial sector the opportunity to discuss a certain number of current topics in particular the new investment charter the new tax measures concerning industrial acceleration waves as well as the new carbon tax at the borders of the european union to talk about all this I have the
it is a pleasure to receive riyad mesur minister of trade industry it is immediately so large format minister of trade industry hello hello you were born in rabat en after high school in casablanca at Lyautey high school where you went to switzerland for your higher education you graduated from the polytechnic school of zurich in you started your career first with abb  a swiss technology engineering group  then you joined the firm of
laws as a consultant in charge of financial services on your return to morocco in you held the position of budget general manager of a subsidiary of the financecom group specializing in long-term leasing two years later you joined the m group initially in as advisor to the chairman before taking over the commercial management of its subsidiary zelijah a company that operated in the metallurgy sector in you managed suzuki morocco another subsidiary of
  the summit specializing in automobile distribution in july you were appointed chief of staff of the ministry of trade industry who was then moulafé de alami on october king mohammed vi appointed you minister of industry and trade well then first question semi if you allow a first question we are going to talk about football morocco signed a performance more than we will have a historic performance he was able to reach the semi-final of the cup for the first time
 this is the worldhe first country which was able to reach this level of competition first how you experienced this historic sequence to tell you the truth I have not yet returned from this historic sequence we are still in the middle of it it's a moment of joy it's a moment of happiness it's a moment of pride is a moment of sharing and the most important of all that is that it is a moment that allows Morocco to understand the value of what they are  what they are capable of doing and what
that they are capable of achieving and that for me is the greatest feat that our national team has achieved. We have exceptional qualities. We have the capabilities to achieve because we call feats but world-class performances in all sectors and in all areas. football has proven it today in a clear and obvious manner to prove it to the whole world but what matters most to me is that it has been proven to the Moroccan and my fellow citizens finally understand that
They are capable of achieving everything and you as Minister of Industry how can we capitalize on this feat and nibble new publicity points improve things perhaps seduce new industrialists first of all the image of Morocco is to be strongly reinforced by the achievements of our team national but I will tell you the industrialists talk among themselves even know each other in the world it is a small world somewhere at the level of the operators and already know
throughout the world the value of our country and the performance of our human capital and the performance of our investor support system the flat relevance of our sectoral strategies carried by his majesty the king that God is assisting Morocco is very very attractive at the level industrial Morocco is achieving exceptional performances at the industrial level. We are quite confident that we are only at the start of an even more important industrial adventure.
ore denser even more carrying wealth and jobs and of course anything that can strengthen the notoriety and image of our country is good to take thank you for this transition precisely how is the industry well you are in charge we are in December can we say today that the crisis is behind us not only can we say that the crisis is behind us but we can also say that we have never been so efficient in our history first of all to do the analysis
of the crisis we have recovered approximately in employment that means if we were then we had in terms of jobs before the crisis we have more today in terms of performance we have we have never exported so much at the industrial level for give you an example we are at a little more than billions at the end of October and therefore we intend for the first time to have more than billions of dirhams of industrial exports of manufactured products in our country and this is a first
 is a prerequisite for all sectors then we are going to take the four emblematic sectors of our country for the first time in its history Morocco will exceed billions of dirhams of automobile exports for the first time in its history Morocco will exceed billions of dirhams that's it we have exceeded the billions of the automobile we are in months I say we are in so we are almost sure that we will end the year with more things except big surprise and
 the indicators show that so far we are heading towards billions so this is something exceptional for the first time in our history we will exceed billions of dirhams in the textile export sector for the first time in our history we will exceed billions inchallah of exports in the agri-food industry sector agri-food industry not the agricultural sector for the first time in our history inchallah at the end of the year
we are going to exceed billions of dirhams in aeronautical exports so all these are exceptional indicators which we must rejoice in which we must analyze which we must further accentuate in order to go even further you mentioned industrial employment and you say that industrial employment is doing well but there are always some observers who question the statisticsques communicated by the ministry of industry it is a classic question they say that we find
e not the figures communicated by your ministry at the level of the figures of the hc yes where does this difference come from then the difference is very simple the difference is very simple we pilot our statistics according to the records of the cnss that means each month we take the industrial companies and we look at what the cnss declared as employment and we said that of course we make corrections and we have different indicators that show the volume of employment are these people that
i work on a temporary basis are these people who work on a long-term basis what is the number of hours worked etc so we are doing an analysis in relation to actual declarations employs by declared employment on the other side we have the hcp who does work in accordance with international doctrine and international best practices that we do not dispute that a work that is done on the basis of an investigation means it is assessments of the estimates that take
 possibly take into account the figures of the cnss professions which take into account the investigations and the declarations of the operators which are made in the field and it is a sample therefore indeed there can be differences of the differences compared to this appreciation which is good with the figures hcp is that they can also capture a trend on the informal that we capture not in relation to our figures but in an infinite global way we end up finding ourselves on the
e long term so let's get back to the automotive sector all the major car manufacturers in the world have started to switch to electric the question how do you see yourself as minister of industry the positioning of the Moroccan automotive industry in the years to come is the moroccan industrial platform is ready to ensure this switch to electric or do you think that morocco should position itself by specializing in thermal cars
mics intended for emerging countries the two mont general the two my general thermal is not dead thermal still has a bright future ahead of it and not only in emerging countries because it is possible that after the electric wave we will move on to another wave that uses also thermal whether it is a hydrogen wave or a gas wave or a wave related to methanol or something else there is a trans solutions to be done so the thermal is still about fifteen years old or twenty years old
very ahead of him such considers today the hybrid is a transition that will be used in emerging countries and in developed countries and of course the electric transition is important since our main export market which is europe after a firm decision in relation to the electric of a changeover in and that the evolution of market expectations are starting to show that there is a market in electricity so where is Morocco in all this first of all Morocco prod
uit already electric we have a production capacity today of to electric vehicles in the micro mobility mockery I will come back to this it is extremely important electric product and our capacity which has already been announced will increase to approximately vehicles in the next three years on the capacity that we will have in three years  which is from to a million vehicles  that's already been done on the second part on the second part the transition we started working with
ec manufacturers on hybridization and we are working on it and on the third component which is classic electric mobility we are working on the establishment of electric battery battery production infrastructure to serve the Moroccan platform and the international platform we have very good assets for that and fairly pronounced interests or even acted at the level of interest in certain projects in this direction and we
we are working with our manufacturers to ensure that current models can be predisposed to accommodate electrics and future models can be engaged either in the flanges or in the electrics that's for the work we do behind that there are rrisks we are not free from risk the risks are that today there is a different appreciation of our economic partners in relation to the role of morocco in electric mobility let me explain there are
  risks of non-tariff barriers or with our traditional partners that we are discussing  hence the importance of the green pact with the European Union  etc. there are also assets Morocco and probably one of the best positioned countries in the region and when I speak of the region i am talking about third of the globe europe mediterranean africa to be one of the major sources of production if not the main one of electric battery you recently announced that morocco is about to
produce a moroccan car who is behind the project and what do you mean by a moroccan company so i did not specify this moroccan it was interpretations i wanted to talk about marc maroquet since the issue me all the cars that happen in morocco are moroccan first whatever their brand and there are even cars that have foreign brands that have a much higher integration rate than what  for example  the Moroccan brand will have which is
n preparation we have an initiative a Moroccan investment to produce a vehicle which is in the process of being approved by the authorities who are in charge of the crediting and approval of these of these operators we are working with them the vehicle we have it ourselves we had the chance to see it in preview and I think that some of your colleagues have already spoken to you too and this vehicle will all be successfully tested and will be offered to customers.
 Moroccan with extremely interesting and competitive prices and we are happy to be able to on the price level I think it's around dirhams if but if my indications are good we have good hopes and experiences of Moroccan vehicles have already existed we all know menara etc of the cities or the raquis of the vehicles with seduction and which have and which made us honor and which make us happy and which are in the memory of many car enthusiasts at the level
at the Moroccan level  this is the first vehicle  we will say mas market  which can be made available to Moroccan households which will bear a Moroccan name with whom we work to increase the integration rate so that the parts that are in it are also in the long term mainly so that there are other models that it makes small to accompany it in this initiative and we are proud that Moroccan investors are starting to want to carry this industry including
s at the brand level so it is intended mainly for the local market for the moment for the moment but we are confident and we will support doing the wall we can so that this operation has an international dimension we have been hearing about the imminent arrival of a Morocco's third largest car manufacturer in Morocco has even signed a contract with the Chinese bide to install an electric car factory in Tangier  this project unfortunately fell through.
water why morocco is still unable to attract a third builder morocco is ideally positioned to attract any builder but you should know that the market is not forbidding me that there is a third a fourth or a fifth you should know that the main market to which we sell our vehicles is the European market and as you know the European market and globally the world market for automobiles is today we are falling it is a mar
ché which is down and therefore the existing capacities are not used at so the purchase is down there are also bottleneck issues as you know at the level of the value chain we are talking about this microductor but it is not only semiconductors there are also some raw materials that are not available etc. and therefore with a declining market of existing capacities investments that have already been made that manufacturers are trying to fill today
today it is difficult whatever the competitive position of our country to attract a third manufacturer even if the possibility exists second point which is extremelyimportant is that this market is down Morocco has increased its exports to this market in terms of vehicles so we are gaining market share and the relevance of the positioning of the platform and its Moroccan automotive competitiveness has never been so strong so our attack activity is strong the c
the competitiveness of our competitors is down the market is down and in this equation the transfers the new investments the reflections on the near or medium term future in all this context there our country and among the best positioned in the world to increase capacities so here we go we work in a context in this context we make our platform work at full speed we consolidate it we strengthen it so that it is even better or tilled to attract a third
 or a fourth manufacturer a word on the new investment charter for a few days in fact morocco has a new investment charter the text has just been published in the official bulletin you who are in permanent contact with industrialists investors do you think that the new device with all the bonuses which contains the territorial sector bonuses etc the business climate component does this new device meet the needs
s specific to industrialists you are asking yourself the question of a member of the government who carries this investment charter I cannot say yes because first this charter was drawn up within the framework of dialogue  discussion and exchange of consultation with industrialists it was also made to improve or institutionalize the investment mechanisms that have been put in place and to also correct some certain certain shortcomings of the mechanism exist and also and others
if in order to better direct investment in the regions  then obviously this system is a system that is more efficient is a system that is fairer in terms of territorial equity is a system that is more open to all investors from all the sectors concerned is a system who is I think and I know from the discussions we have and with the highly valued and highly anticipated operators and what is expected of you as
ministry of industry what is the role of the ministry of industry it is always the implementation it is always the it is for the same we have a role of preparing infrastructures we have a role of consolidating ecosystems we have a role of orientation we have a role of cross-functional support purchasing from a very specific role in all this support system the role of supporting and setting up the financial support of the state but beyond the financial support of the state there is the whole
industrial strategy there is all the support for ecosystems there is all the training that needs to be put in place there is all the infrastructure that needs to be put in place and there is the whole system for managing the integration attraction value chain with the other value chains it is a complex and complementary system and I imagine that you also have a strategic role that of the choice of strategic sectors and priority sectors we have today
i we have a pack the sectors that we have here competitive sectors the non-competitive sectors and the new sectors created so it's again not how you are going to manage all that and especially the complementarities that could exist between you and the department in charge of investment with the investment department we know each other well it's a team there is no differentiation everyone is in their role and both being oriented to create employment and
 value for our country so that is quite clear and and it is quite complementary and besides beyond that the borders are flexible because if there is a better aptitude on one side or another to convince or to bring back or install an investor we let ourselves gladly we gladly pass the ball so that things go as well as possible so the choices yes the choices are important but we returned to Morocco you did not miss the world cup we showed in a way
re claire morocco has moved to another scale we aremy past on a scale where this country is completely open to the initiative or the act of investing and supports it as best as it can while obviously trying to organize to create more value not to control development but to create more value in a country where everyone is free to invest create value innovate and recruit last october during the opening of the session of parliament the king called for the
development of national impact for investment there are set new objectives billions of dirhams of investment to mobilize and create jobs my question that it will be the share of industry in these investments and in these jobs how we are ambition we want to take everything as we are ambitious we want take everything of course this pact that his majesty to ask to put in place is a very ambitious pack and an impact which also aligns with the objectives set by the sovereign
in order to ensure that development is driven by private investment today when it is traditionally a little more driven by public investment so he has set a course the sovereign has set a set an objective we are all mobilized at government level to to achieve this goal and if i can take everything to achieve it i will do it well so everyone is talking lately about decarbonization but on the ground it seems that almost nothing
is done in the field of industry the novelty this week is that on tuesday december the european union officially adopted the mechanism let us introduce the carbon tax at the borders my question what are the concrete actions taken by the ministry of industry to accelerate the decarbonization of moroccan industry i can't imagine a warning watcher like you telling me he feels like nothing would have been done decarbonization is a
n process which has been under way for a very long time at the level of our country first and at the level of the industry for a few years things are quite clear and well fixed the programs you have them and your support has largely covered them but I will recall them for remove this impression and I imagine that you are reporting the impression of our listeners let's take the personal example because I can't believe it am I taking the example of access to medium voltage for example
e it did not escape you then it was signed ten days ago under the chairmanship of Mr. Head of Government of an agreement between all the actors to allow direct access to medium voltage to all industrialists in our country I think as you didn't escape you even included it in your support so it's done it's going to be put into operation it's going to be operational from January next year and therefore the medium voltage is a settled subject
 by this government which was not settled by previous governments and we are quite proud of it in relation to that so the medium voltage is settled or there it is not just electricity today that's it things at the electrical level self-production has just been to be voted on at the parliament level you see that we are even in the process of opening a lot of self-production sites of several operators etc and it will multiply third thing we put in place two
x years a tattooed program for green growth which supports the transition of SMEs because we know that the big companies today and we are going to take the example of the manufacturers when we take the Renault factory in Tangier it is net net carbon footprint so the multinationals are committed to them have already reached  if not they are above the thresholds set for being able to access the international market  we have been implementing a transfer program for years and
support for our SMEs which is called green growth which today supports at the level of studies up to or amount and investments up to to be able to ensure this shift and not only in electricity let's stay in the carbon tax at the borders and I will ask you perhaps to be a little more didactic towards companies  what does that change in concrete terms  what does that mean forMoroccan companies what are the sectors concerned
ernes and from what moment it will apply what is clear is that there are six options at the level of what was voted by the European Union then these six options are differential we are talking either about the steel sector cement etc. here we are apart we are talking about this sector there after what we are going to take into account at the level of steel I take the example is it the export must be crude with respect to the European Union which will be taken care of or is it the steel content of the pro
deduct that we are sending to the level of the European Union all this has not yet been taken all these are mechanisms which are being put in place we have the means to calculate the six options and we are following them in a very interesting way and then in these products what is the value of the products what are the products that will be affected beyond that the calculation it can be done in a different way is the calculation based on the production certificate of the entity that
I produce with the necessary traceability or we take an average what the European Union is trying to do and that's a little more complicated we take an average in relation to a country and there too we try to position ourselves either as a country and in as an individual producer to ensure that this carbon tax is not a disadvantage for our competitiveness but on the contrary an advantage because we should not see it as something that is burdensome for our industrialists i
we must see it as something that can eliminate it from competition know that we today in Morocco in terms of electricity for example by producing from renewable electricity we produce less expensively than by producing from carbon electricity in what we signed on the medium voltage there will be advantages and it will be much more competitive than what we have today of course the advantages can be quantified according to consumption that's technical
and it's quite complicated but it will be cheaper and significantly less expensive and second of the things if in this system there is also the logistical part the proximity of Morocco will ensure that it will be even more advantageous compared to its traditional competition so believe I see this system in relation to Morocco's positioning in relation to its qualities but also in relation to its long-standing commitment without ulterior motive to develop under the leadership of an impulse from
his majesty a very committed sustainable development strategy we are today positioned to consider this border adjustment mechanism as a rather recommended advantage therefore to remain confident no risk no risk on the complicity of the global industry there may be sectoral risks on which we are working there are risks for example in relation to the recycling of fabric on which we work in a very precise and very clear way we have work to do
and so the private sector is associated with this day-to-day transition in relation to that we have things to do we have not finished but we have places to take you have just said it now that Morocco has energy to low cost can we say today that the industry is profitable today compared to other sectors I cite for example construction real estate I do not want to make a comparison with other sectors what I can see on the other hand is that at the level
 of the volume of investments and the share of industry compared to the share of real estate and a real inversion compared to years ago that means roughly speaking we are going to keep it simple in the ideas there was industrial real estate years ago today the factors have reversed themselves so visibly economic operators consider industrial investment today as attractive and as more attractive than real estate investment state policy has been it has been for good
suddenly the development of industrial sectoral strategies demonstrated that it was a promising sector and a profitable and competitive sector and today we are quite confident that not only is it one of the most profitable and competitive sectors but it is also one of the sectors where there is huge perspectivestives of job creation and value for our country so speaking of renewable energy we have recently seen Morocco attract more and more international investors
nationals several international investors have expressed their desire to come and invest in morocco in hydrogen etc. my question to you as minister of industry in return for wind and solar resources what does morocco gain because there is an industrial component which should be insisted on i take the example of x lix how does it feel to you to hear that this project there megap project the initiator of this project is going to build a factory in scotland to produce
 cable instead of building this factory in Morocco I would have liked to see it and I would have liked to see it but know that we are going to do that it is a billion dollar project more or less in this project the customer is who the customer is Great Britain the Great Britain tell me to buy this electricity I need industrial integration I can't take it away from him he's the one who pays so he says I'm asking for industrial integration so I'm asking for billions so whoever does this
 project like us when we do a project we ask for halal industrial integration from there what is left for me to take me I have billions moreover to take so it's billions I'm going to get them I'm going to go and take them I can build wind turbines me pale hands etc i can build batteries and that too is part of my portfolio to attract investors to store energy i can use this capacity to desalinate water and
so i have at least some added value to look for i'm going to get the maximum the maximum that i can look for in it so beyond that to give you the diagram and the diagram is simple it was the subject of a meeting at his majesty's level and and from a press release from a press release from the royal cabinet this development makes us change scale that's what we have to say to ourselves we are going from projects with hundreds of millions of dirhams to hundreds of millions of euros to projects for milli
ards of euros and what does it change it changes in everything we can put around behind that means we come with projects like that we come with the capacity not only to supply hydrogen electricity to the world and we become the indecent of global energy security imagine what does that mean but from there we start to have electricity and heat for our country that we can use to develop all industry to deliver all industry not only
t for these projects but also to have access to unimaginable quantities of energy which will allow us to transform our country not only at the industrial level but also at the level of its access to water and that is exceptional what is happening in our countries look at this with confidence it is going to be transformative speaking of water there are also seawater desalination projects there again what is the contribution of the ministry of industry the contribution of the ministry of industry
It is clear everything that is built as infrastructure the Ministry of Industry will seek the maximum integration and the maximum potential to integrate either Moroccan operators or to attract investors so that they can do local integration so all these infrastructure projects whether this is the way of iron whether it is desalination whether it is energy whether it is any other infrastructure project in our country the entire government is mobilized to ensure
e that the local added value on the most important possible therefore which is of the perennial industrial creation not only for this project but for the continuation and that there is job creation then let us take the example of the station of thessallement of casablanca largest in africa did you have the right to look at the characteristics or industrial aspects of obviously on the right no we participated we contributed we proposed the activities of our ecosystem is
moreover even better still the bidders have every interest in making our competitive industries work rather than making sure to bring back modules all done all that comes within the framework of the sgovernment strategy to ensure that public money is Moroccan money  certainly to make Moroccans work first  then if we don't know how to do it competitively we look at it hurts we digest we learn and we work to be better positioned the next time
is because it is not the last installed station so we are going to do there you are talking about the national preference we are talking about the national preference but we are not talking about the national preference in a way we are going to say wild the national preference just I am even talking about the chance give the chance to the national operator the master on an equal footing ensure that he is considered to be trusted like what happened in the world trust in Morocco give them their chance and
 you will see and you will see that it is at the level of public money that it is the level of public contracts that it is at the level of the leaders that it is at the level of the young people that we recruit you will see if you allow with the taxation the parliament has just adopted the finance bill there was a whole debate on the new tax measures  in particular those relating to industrial acceleration zones  the elimination of tax advantages for companies established in zones
s of industrial acceleration what ultimately changed because there were so many amendments along the way and is this fiscal instability not likely to reduce the attractiveness of the Moroccan industrial platform it's difficult to call its fiscal instability what it takes what it takes you have to understand that we work according to priorities and that's normal  that people who earn a little more profit are a little more united because we have projects
 extremely important social and enormous social needs the biggest project carried by his majesty which is the project of universal social protection for all which is a project which is extremely structuring for our society requires financing and this financing we are not going to go to look in the pocket of those who do not have and do not take it in the pocket of that which does not create profit so it is normal which is tax fairness that the one who earns more than million
s of dirhams contribute up to or gradually so that it is up to now in the current conditions under discussion and the government is listening to the proposals of all the operators during this debate because parliament is a space of institutionalized debate it was considered preferable not to take this measure that year and to continue to reflect to see what is the best option a word on this vase construction site of sovereign
industrial sector the ministry mentions import substitution projects with the objective of creating jobs can you share with us the results of this strategy at the moment t then at the moment t we went from I don't know when did you have this information to projects so it's something that evolves the project intentions arrive on a daily basis we will say we are at more or less two or three new projects per day and this is exceptional which is
 moving on to the level of activity I come back to the term attractiveness of the industry for national and international investors because you need to know that today investors are national investors in the industry so at the level of sovereignty we are on an extremely positive dynamic on projects which are being realized day after day  even better what is extremely interesting is that these projects are reinvestments therefore
 these are sound people who have already invested in the industry who have succeeded and who consider that this is the time to grow or to do something else  which means that we are in an extremely positive dynamic which is transformative which is not only part of the transformation process through foreign investment but I repeat it is Moroccan capital and today even better within the framework of the new investment charter which also provides for a regionalization of
the slightly broader management of investment management can you imagine that today we have gonea system where flows of projects come directly from the regions without going through us and that is exceptional how to convince the investor today to choose the industry give us at least three reasons that could encourage an investor to orient his choice towards the industry because today the first thing when we makes an investment beyond the economic aspect and a
 aspect do something you know the investors contrary to what we believe it is often said that the company is there to make profits we learn that in all the courses of all the universities the investor wants to mark to do an act that marks like any human being today investing in industry means creating jobs and creating value and participating in the development of society and that is the first thing we feel and in these sovereign projects.
seniority we see a lot of importers who are telling me what I am doing I am in the process of getting people from abroad to work you have shown me that we are capable of doing it competitively at home I am going to do it and I am going to create the value for my country I'm going to fight for the jersey that's the first thing second thing it's today as in the discussion of one of the most profitable investment activities we see that certain sectors are a little
 less profitable than before and a little less liquid in any case  but at the industrial level are increasingly profitable sectors the third there are enormous opportunities today we are at the opportunity sheets that the ministry has identified has posted we are not going to arrive yet with new new opportunities in a few weeks which are linked to innovation so there are a lot of potential projects and fourthly there is a market thanks to the free trade agreements which today we infinitely
 is among the most competitive in the world among the cleanest in the world among the most productive in the world among the most inventive in the world it remains only to be among the most ambitious in the world this is what the world cup has demonstrated and this is what we ask our operators to learn as a lesson to go and conquer the world with all these assets this minister before closing this genocity program three names and I am going to ask you to give a short comment for each of these numbers
who am I by moissines jazouli so an essential player in the government team to develop the ability to attract investment and therefore for me the major partner at government level to seek out government industrialists without whom we cannot move projects forward and the strategies we want to move our ministry forward third and last name moula reference as minister industry minister of trade industry thank you d
see accepted our invitation thank you thank you to you dear Internet users for having followed this program see you very soon
madam sir good evening on the menu of news questions this evening the non-participation of morocco in the vote at the general assembly of the un on the subject of the russo-ukrainian crisis and then in the second part the rise in the cost of living so in this first part we will first of all company of my dear guests this evening we are going to come back to this position of morocco visàvis the conflict in ukraine a position in alignment with international law in particular on this question of territorial integrity
 and the national unity of all member states of the UN and then in the second part as I said it is about soaring prices of course soaring prices combined with a drought how the government can respond to the grievances of millions of Moroccans on the weakening of their purchasing power to respond will join us annan two columns members of the alliance of istiqlalian economists is notable for the wii nen worth of the national council of the usf and but before so i have the pla
isir to welcome but is the guest this evening my strength through the sieve good evening madam thank you very much for your invitation thank you for accepting it I remind you you are an expert in geopolitics university professor and another professor this time in international law also joined us with questions dactu good evening asaq is linked to godard thank you linthen but if we start perhaps first by describing perhaps the situation today on the ground is what we can say
 that finally russia is in the process of taking the cren on through the crime but listen today to the situation and the vagueness in this setting knowing very well today for example yesterday there was the seizure of the grieving at risk on the bank on the city of ground and after so there was an attack across the crimea towards the city of mario paul who is now besieged and who therefore succeeds militarily speaking he is carrying out a siege tactic i.e. in the process of ca
 if i have a lot of currency especially the city of aki also going to the city of the capital of the capital also of kiev i was thinking about km according to american information it is km from the city center of kiev so i think today that there is a strategy a little bit to encircle the south coast of the dany bar river because it is the river a little bit there is a population that is pro-Russian what is called the plateau of low dole so I think here is the situation it is alarming n
especially with the meteoric rise in the number of refugees  therefore in European countries  and also with the place of a porcupine strategy on the part of the Ukrainians  which means that today the duration of this armed conflict will last over time and we are in one in a clash so if mik between two actors between several actors besides international emotion what really hovers an endless war if there is not really a common vision to lead good
s offices and also a mediation we are sure and certain talks between the antagonists so interesting this question of mediation it is the only solution without you in the presence of a few tables to sulk sorry to get out of this conflict what mediation there was of course talks there will be talks but with what result finally but exactly let's say to systematize there are two types of means to settle disputes firstly if we back up to the charter of nations
united nations the chapter that is worded peaceful settlement of disputes consultations there are negotiations and in conciliation there is judicial settlement the limit if we could also  as perhaps the cren had not already done in relation to the international court of justice unfortunately this way I would say not was buried definitively because we know that there are meetings between the two parties but it was at least ruled out the second solution of course is when
we move on to the chapter which is worded this time means of coercion when the security council acting we ransack qualities of defender of international peace and security could activate either first the sanctions which a certain number of countries have already done but the council has knows him was disabled due to or because of the Russian blockade the right to veto otherwise he could at that time authorized the use of force and therefore material duress when you see
ez this question was not programmed in the sense that the blockage did not allow this option which is in any case extremely dangerous what remains today is that today at the level of the international community there would be first of all a consensus or a readiness to do so the european union the united states the countries which weigh on the world scene in front of china has taken a rather particular position that of these countries a troika for example could prevent
her russia to sign and persist and continue in its momentum in its offensive as even with all the damage we see today in front of the TVs so it is regretting me I believe that perhaps the option that remains today is to push towards more pressure on russia in particular maybe china has to come out economic cdl case not in this sense mediation who isolated the adviser from all aspects a little bit about you it goes from sport to the economy i feel because even the european union
 must perhaps change shouldered rifles instead of using the language of threat and so on and let's forget this question of Ukraine's membership at least momentarily within nato it would be necessary as well that the other one will say the other body can onewatered things down a little in my opinion to preserve the planet against a lot of scourge because here we are talking about nuclear power of the first rank and therefore in the end it will be necessary in my privileged opinion rather the sense of listening to moderation is
 examined today how we can do to preserve what has to preserve what is to preserve unfortunately the extremely deplorable and worrying situation the general assembly of the un yesterday demanded that russia immediately resort to violence and force against ukraine perhaps a analysis on the votes you mentioned the veto vote photo of Russia and some countries to name only Eritrea and other countries but the position of certain countries is not clear to you
perhaps surprise or it was very expected in relation to this vote yesterday at the UN general assembly so there is then a two three four posture following the vote which took place yesterday at the level of the general assembly which met in an emergency extraordinary meeting firstly those who voted for members of course the idea by the united states etc others voted against like north korea like russia it goes without saying belarus as well as others still others who preferred the abst
tion and I believe that it is more countries seems to me including Algeria Iran China and other countries China but there are other countries I believe seven or eight who have decidedly preferred not to take and not to pronounce themselves and there we could perhaps speak of a somewhat neutral posture of neutrality leaving it precisely to whom it is entitled to give meaning to this posture of course if you want me to talk about Morocco we can do it maybe what will speak to them it is our opinion but I believe
see that there is unfortunately a cleavage at the zoo today which comes out of this vote yesterday so that absolutely and those who why why there is this cleavage today in abu dhabi firstly the interests are not the same those of all the worst it goes without saying even perception of the conflict third perhaps that even russia today we are still at the beginning but I do not know if the bogging down thereafter possibly use of dangerous weapons is prohibited because already the international right
rnational humanitarian was recalled by the resolution therefore violation at this time there would necessarily be a change of position we are at the beginning perhaps those who took this position still hope that the conflict can take a more or less attenuated pace and that we can get out of this quagmire you talked about morocco's position this sovereign decision of morocco not to vote after sister travel roudani not to vote how what analysis of this position taking
we from Morocco in relation to this vote yesterday the general assembly of the UN so the first thing which is very important know science have conscience it is the street it is the ruin of the soul so today there is a certain competition and global competition or around leadership or else around the half on the strategic logics on the scale of the restructuring of the world order and in fact today in front of sète this armed conflict between russia lukraine it is very important to underline that
 given that the United Nations Security Council has primary jurisdiction to ensure peace and security and to settle this kind of situation  unfortunately  which are deplorable as our friend zakaria describes it and today what I see for example in this vote seen the scale because we are in a crisis it is not a conflict on a European scale but it is a conflict with repercussions on an international scale so much more so today we see these equations
geostrategic ations which is settling in the goods which is in the process of impregnating this armed conflict so we see that there are weak links Africa the Arab world and Latin America and in fact today I see that this vote with the back of the UN is a your is to say it's like it's a Manichean conflict that is to say today we impose a Manichean vision of the world the good and the bad knowing well that we need the restraint of wisdom and in fact I think that the posit
ion of the Kingdom of Morocco of the non-participation in this vote which should be recalled that which is not a binding resolution and the non-participantsconstraining is symbolic is a wise and balanced decision and wise because it draws on the settlement of conflicts at the united nations level is also a magnificent element here is to be weighed because let us not forget today that if today we are talking about the cold war the cold war never ceased to exist and to continue to exist within the
united nations security council and in fact the iron curtain can really fall again and in fact today the repercussions on property the impacts on our ears and the impacts of this conflict will affect several relationships I think that today the kingdom of Morocco and elsewhere the february press release suzanne foreigners it was clear and lucid morocco and for the territorial integrity of states is also morocco never accepts the use of force to settle disputes
 either the conflicts between member countries of the united nations it is a diplomatic fight morocco knows very well today here is that it can be what is called in the diplomatic philosophy of the kingdom of morocco which has always advocated dialogue good offices besides it has experience very important in peace and security in africa and in the israeli-palestinian conflict  morocco has never and therefore promoted to engage in an armed conflict to resolve a dispute whose f
have today in front of this situation in front of sète this conflict which could really have impacts they could have shock waves which turns would affect the Arab world the political skirt of the Maghreb the skirt meetic of several of the African continent so I think today this decision it is strategic and also it must be remembered that Morocco this decision hardly comes under this dark veil of its perception in strategic relations with the United States with the European Union
opean with which morocco maintains solid stable relations is also safe and there is mutual trust moreover morocco in the fight against terrorism is a it plays a key role in the coalition to fight against terrorism against tight fields in iraq l Morocco is committed body and soul to ensure peace and security alongside American and European forces and therefore in fact today this crisis between Russia and Ukraine imposes a vision which must be who must
t advocate therefore uncertain certain wisdom in the perception of the resolution because to do try to because continue in this momentum of war like that with the super luminous speed of here to help hostilities it will lead to a world war some have been alarmist besides the head of french diplomacy jean yves le drian declared just this morning that the worst would be to come in any case according to him we will perhaps come back with a comment on this but stay on
s on this abstention from morocco and can we make a link between this reminder of morocco of the principle of non-use of force to settle disputes between countries and the fact that morocco is once a member of countries for the purpose of movement from the non-aligned countries professor abou dhabi so how precisely can we interpret the latitude of morocco where its position is in relation to the resolution which was adopted by the majority to recall it by the general assembly of the united nations so
nt countries have been for its medical series exactly it is unprecedented I believe firstly if we had adopted the posture of abstention it could have been interpreted as an implicit refusal that is to say in other words it would have been said at that time that Morocco does not agree with the condemnation of russia and that consequently more or less he would give him reason me I draw the parallel for example you know the resolution we criticized the position of tunisia abstention said ba
h well tunisia has not taken a position in favor of morocco because this resolution is a little we will say close to the moroccan vision concerning the management of this conflict moreover even russia are abstaining today if we abstain so our position could be interpreted as a implicit refusal of the condemnation the choice that was left it seems to me on the tactical level was simply not to take part in the vote at all and at that moment we would be part of a logic
 almost neutralI would say absolute why because the vote when you do not take part in the vote it is not counted that said one thing must be said very important because he had the press release yesterday from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is that he registers this position in the case of a package clap a packet ch it means as any brain said in the foreign ministry statement dated last february in which he said they support integrity t
territory of countries and frankly it was there support for Ukraine with whom it must be remembered we also have commercial links of around million euros per year imports to us entirely from Morocco rivals imports our needs in cereals so that said Morocco wants to preserve its strategic interests with russia which is still a leading power on the political and military level and at the same time not permanent within the security council I also believe i
l takes a position with regard to the content of the terms contained in the declaration in the resolution when you say a condemnation and that you qualify lake of russia as being an aggression at this moment you authorize you agree that the international community can take retaliatory measures against this country so at that time you more or less deviate from the logic of peace and security of negotiations and at that time there had been a calculation and a weighting to
in my opinion it was not easy i would say we were even on the razor's edge as we say yes it was extremely delicate but i believe that morocco itself considered that it was not going to lose its strategic alliances with its partners  in particular the united states and the European Union by adopting this posture once again  but the Moroccan posture will have to be understood by its partners precisely in relation to this question of joining the movement.
t of the non-aligned countries and this position of Morocco what can we make a link between the two yes absolutely because Morocco participated in the conference of bands so moreover I believe that he was one of the founders of this movement which was founded I believe leroy the doctor who was one of the followers of this movement and we said somewhere that we are far from the policy of the axes today it is a fearful cause a story which is remade differently we returned to
the logic of the cold war but otherwise therefore war by proxy a new police polarization of the world which is dangerous as I was saying earlier a new cleavage unfortunately we see a little russia with china perhaps with india which abstained abstained yesterday we therefore saw the bricks in south africa also abstained on the part of hans concerning this vote algeria moreover also and position nevertheless enough here it is because they are surprising even to them from the
lgeria in relation to this vote algeria because it is already positioning itself at the gas level with sanctions against russia  in particular algeria has offered to deliver its gas to italy absolutely and we are always looking to win over morocco because each time it is a question of gauging each other certainly had diplomatic negotiations and at the level of the general assembly and I say how delicate it is for our representatives to have a single permanent representative within the United Nations to find a way
  median to defend tenaciously the strategic interests of Morocco a wise voice to use the terms of professor charcot vélo dany lafrique the African countries you spoke earlier about the impact on Africa but why African countries today thielle a certain distance from this conflict listen because today I would just like to add a very important thing is that today the fatal error is to seek to close the world in a manic scheme
I agree through this vote because there it will really be global dislocation and it will be true for the repercussions will be really negative on an international scale the African continent is one of the continents which will be the most impacted through this armed conflict because since very long and therefore that the African continent for example imports of wheat and several for example inthe agri-food sector so there was a lot of import and also because
 that there are strategic relations and with the west and with russia has been for a very long time we have seen that the environment of bilateral relations between several countries of the african continent is also russia has intensified we have seen it with several sauvy h in sochi the europe africa summit and in fact today the fragility of African countries so crazy there it takes the only it happens that this fragility leaves Africans a little perplexed there is a little hesitant especially that there is no
I don't have enough elements to understand that you are conflicting and and you have to say structural because today yes there are people who say of a conflict between the receipt of the creams but I personally see that it is a conflict what I can call geography global politics because we have to go back valade since even before the years on this antagonism between a eyelet veil the wings to the cultural dimension itno in the slavs the other dox legli
se orthodox the catholic church has been moreover for a very long time the orthodox church and the catholic church have not been met except in the airport of havana in cuba and in fact we understand here are also certain stakes also and biological of this ethnic conflict and besides when you see for example the number of inhabitants settle them well the ukrainians of russian origin for example in ukraine it is roughly in the remaining caza for example it is in the za the dhr abidjan will take for its
t also so we also see for example the interconnection between this conflict and certain geopolitical spaces because we must not forget because tomorrow it will be the coca region this has khaled of pacific the restoration of a world order which will move towards a certain political Roberge ans and operational military with china with russia not that it makes you the african continent in front of sète this magma to give this veil to this scrambling above all wolves who exist so it is it
was found trapped it must be said hostage to this conflict between russia and the west and in fact today there is the need to remain in the African evil finished you spoke it is interesting this approach to speak of a conflict which is international today because the conflict clearly is not between russia and ukraine it is an international conflict but suddenly africa does not really have anything to say in a thousand and one points that would drag you into this leave politically by
 west and russia clearly it must be said that there is a weight which treasure is very important in the african continent there are approximately separatist movement there are several gray areas there are several lives already political so we see for example the conflict between between the popular front of tigray with the ethiopian government so somalia the horn of africa so that is to say that really there are areas which could really that the conflict could be accentuated because of this s
oi saying here is the alignment with x or y and in fact today the African continent is really in a situation so between two chairs between two chairs so we don't know what's going on we don't know what the repercussions will be we know not because we are talking about two major players in the United Nations Security Council  we are talking about a power that has nuclear deterrent weapons and in fact a solution must be found between them  the problem and the others.
 within the council it is only united nations yes between the actors of the council its secrets of the united nations as I dikes and it is the first first the competent the first leader to settle in a serene and wise way this conflict which could really be triggered here is the chaos all over the world this is what many observers fear precisely last word this professor from cali in abou dhabi so we talked about the negotiations let's talk about the future to recall this declaration of
 jean yves le drian the worst is yet to come according to you and above all a question which is very important after the resolution after this vote yesterday at the un can we expect a change in the attitude of russia was kremlin good russia yesterday that is to say officially the reaction considersthat the resolution called on Russia therefore the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw therefore withdraw the armed forces of this country and did not allude to any condemnation of its dune
on the other hand it seems that with regard to the continuation of operations on the ground as this putin would like and his team has completely realized the strategic design the fait accompli and we know it there are three demands I believe firstly the demilitarization of Ukraine secondly the legalization of the annexation of Crimea and thirdly we prevent any accession at the level of Lotan now it is logical forcibly it is clear there listen to Mr Badin yesterday am congress
erican who spoke of an isolation of Mr. Putin of aggravation of sanctions etc. there is unfortunately this division was cited by Cellou Dalein when speaking of Manichaeism logical evil well axis of good axis of evil unfortunately a rhetoric which does not help to settle things I will not hide from you not that I myself am extremely worried about the situation of human lives potentially exposed to weapons which can even be prohibited because even the four-page resolution
nuclear bacteriological or other which are prohibited by international humanitarian law I believe that the situation I would say very very serious when we see the declarations made by Russian officials so let's just hope that the Russians themselves will resign themselves to reality listen to the world conscience and preserve some human lives because frankly it would be a cataclysm and it is unprecedented since until today last word quickly to close this discussion e
st above all a good one in any case a vision of the level listen it is a historical turning point we live in a world which is in the process of metamorphosing from a restructuring of the world order we would therefore see the world has never known such a conflict with the parameters of force because as I say it's not Russia against Ukraine but it's Russia against the West against the United States against Europe I think today so we spoke in the history of the Cuban crisis I think that this
crisis there and more pétanque is more serious than the Cuban crisis and therefore there is therefore we must not seek to make it serious because it is those close to the possible aura that the Cuban crisis was between the United States and Russia today the crisis is made the European Union is a bit yes also don't expect x makeena who will come down to find the solution the solution is between the actors who are now involved in this conflict unfortunately like you lava
z sites is Mr. Zakaria the human body now we see what is happening on the scale of this human suffering especially of the Ukrainians who are fleeing their honest country nor their house children who those who search their home so I think today there is a urgency to look for I don't know because diplomacy it was here we have and so here we have in a we invented diplomacy to resolve conflicts to restructure the world order on good bases on the manner
era with which we can conceive peace security I think for example the position of Morocco returned Morocco was always attentive to the advisor the consolidation of peace and security through dialogue through wisdom through restraint how we recalled made a lot of files that for example when we talk about the crisis of the Milow River between the Ivory Coast of Australia and Ghana there was really an imminent explosion of the situation the mans he was there
 to establish a global vision of peace and security in Africa I am thinking of this as a message for the actors who are involved today in this conflict otherwise it will really be global disorder and the straps are already starting to feel the impacts  particularly economic  thank you very much to the teachers working the last thank you very much to the teachers of cali to sulk thank you for having enriched this discussion this is the end of the first part I will see you in a few moments for this
you once talked about the high cost of living  immediately what are the means available to the current Moroccan government to deal with the impact of the outbreak ofs price on the pocket of the citizen and the Moroccan citizen to answer this question I have the pleasure of welcoming on this set this evening to settlers of members of the alliance of istiqlalian economists good evening our game that we thank you for joining us thank you for the invitation at your disposal thank you
they agreed to answer our questions dead serve draoui good evening good evening I remind you that you are a member of the national council of the scfp welcome to you also on the set of news questions thank you very much sir a comment first on the situation will set the scene our columns the situation was alarming where the comments are they alarmist well obviously it's a good question it depends a bit to say what is alarming it's a bit too early it depends on the scenario in which we
 is projected the debate is installed are we facing an additional crisis which is coming to hit Morocco after the cog hill where is this a crisis which will not last when you say the crisis is drought and the crisis they obviously fear they ask the Ukrainian with its consequences which come to be added to the crisis of the water of the gas and the wheat and all the phenomena that we see that the Moroccan consumer begins to see directly in the souks and the epi
ceries so we are in this situation so there are two scenarios either we consider that this crisis beyond the drought beyond which often happens in Morocco that we know how to manage a little maybe this year is a little more complicated year than usual but generally we do I succeeded it is not the first time that we do not see but this time we have been betraying what has been said for years according to the words of the Minister of Agriculture yes we want current it is the drought years this
you year so me personally i think it's a crisis that of ukraine is a crisis that will last so this assumption the sweat from this assumption where i build a reasoning the government seems rather to fit into the scenario that the crisis is not going to go last and resonate you do well to say it because the minister industry needs two reminded him yesterday in an interview with tv media that the crisis could not last could not last it is still p
read for even me I rather think we can diverge even with our ministers we are in the reasoning in the forecast in the little speculation controller between the two circles ania obviously we do not all think the same thing we do not discuss it we tried to convince the other day we are in the minority this question of the crisis for your people it will last it will have the same impact as I am Ukrainian today I find myself in this situation it is a crisis which will last the problem of
the drought is going to be serious in the summer that is to say the water cuts the risks of electricity water cuts etc it is rather there is no immediate emergency there is no emergency in Ramadan mode there are stocks we know how to manage we have leeway but what they are managing is July August September obviously this is the critical moment of and if there is a conjunction of the two crises it will be complicated the opposition has called that of course a lot of things have changed since these elections
elements that were or on which we based ourselves to put in place this bill says in this finance law in this case millions a production of millions of quintals of cereals we are very far from it we hope to reach a third of this projection a barrel of dollars it has already come close to and exceeded the dollar bar so the opposition has to has proposed some opposition parties have proposed that resort to an amending finance law is this still
topicality the morale of the wii is this one of the solutions to deal with these unprecedented crises that Morocco is facing today thank you if it is for an amending finance law I said yes it is more than topical why because a law finance which was programmed long before the advent of this government and was based on strong assumptions which are the price of a barrel of oil or rather we transformed it into the tent of butane and a harvest
e cereal and a cereal harvest the assumptions had to be made.widened in a rather particular situation marked by the sequelae which are structural of the pandemic which have not been sufficiently taken into consideration I appreciate that this skull is saying about itself which as soon as it diverges with its minister it can but it is it is dense we dance we say current in the formulation could and the less good ideas which confirms that what we think of the opposition it is part
old but in silence but we get started your awareness that your formulation of things is not our subject gentlemen returning to the amending finance law and or in any case in relation to this talk to come is what you think of course the alliance of economists istiqlaliens to propose certain measures to be taken urgently to respond to the urgency of the high cost of living your comment on this that the opposition is proposing today to this government to better manage these
hazards because these are vagaries  either climatic or geopolitical  what we are proposing first of all is our own destiny  it is to review these majority structures the relations that are made with the opposition against the opposition brought solutions recommendations she even rang the bell alarmed on the realization of spins forward long before the month of February we talked about how the model which is in the s
Underlying should be the new development model there is a certain distance a de-inking from this line that morocco wants morocco with all its components joe rite is strong there was opposition on the legislative body that was not heard in time because you said it well there's no need to fall into numbers we can make them talk as we want let's look at the future the future the situation is serious is very serious and the repercussions we will feel them
r not only but they will we take care accompany us and even in then in the face of crises in a combination of crisis a combination of crisis the crisis russo Ukrainian will come yes added its touch eliminate them the world and the world we will like price which will depend on exterior has been negative there will be negative externalities indeed are cereal pumps but why we have said why for several years with a green morocco plan we have not succeeded in developing
a certain self-sufficiency and a certain rationalization of investments in agriculture so that we remain strongly dependent on our relations of these supplies why the question and the sks that we risk a shortage today finally tomorrow in case the crisis gets bogged down in ukraine obviously prices are high prices has been a reality today for a few months well before the crisis by creating the conjunction between the price and its rigor we can play the compensation we can comp
enser the prices but the problem the real problem is the availability absolutely sibility because the problem of what we buy from the ussr and billions of dirhams against the ussr is also I am old no but because she is subsidizing them far from seeing this idea but there ukraine also which was part of the ussr also exports to morocco in fact you just said but this color what interests me today is what i still have from ukraine its recipes so a lot of wheat
 a lot of grain cereals and so on and so on the same if it's the same thing we are on figures of billions diesel these two billion that we import so it is obvious if it is only a question of price in the pinnacle it costs the budget but the problem it's that I have to find it not everyone those who all the people who matter to me are from russia and ukraine are going to get these products elsewhere than yesterday there is a huge effort from the government for what we said coach
 and Moroccan importers to create a certain collusion with the important cadets and were able to vote on other sources of supply and mobilize the economic adviser at the level of the embassies of the countries exporting these products which we risk missing and we need mobilization and we need not put themselves in a situation which can be serious which is not yet serious but the majority and opposition government in this storyire there is no majority has no opposition
n if morocco lacks injured everyone is penalized so there is a mobilization created there is a monitoring cell created to avoid everything to reduce the consequence of this scarcity of products and the additional cost that must be paid even if it means you you talked about amending finance law I say no it's not topical we have to wait a bit if there were to be an amending finance law it's pretty good second quarter of the year in the third quarter of the year
born it's my wheel we see a budget way or do we have to cut see some people only see budget management but not at all obvious this year budget management has never been seen as you were saying a while ago we are faced with several crises yes therefore no let us not forget that Morocco is engaged in a social reform which is nevertheless substantial and tri-budgetary therefore education and are absolutely therefore how etc generalization of social coverage
behind his back how to meet his needs is what you think today the government is really ready to respond to these emergencies the government obviously works in the short term medium term and long term yes he has three terms an example the government disembark finds the program of dams and desalination plants delayed by years therefore in the medium term and must accelerate its programs sicily if we had not lost ten years with the former majority perhaps these problems
ths would be less of a slightly lighter order but the state of a state of the situation is that the dams which had to be built in terrible delay and desalination which could have saved the situation etc etc so the government will act on an acceleration which require enormous investments so tomorrow to put it in the medium term  that is to say  whether it is this quarter  that of July  August  September  these are measures for resilience for the conjunction of these problems and
 immediate immediate is that I went to the gas pump this morning diesel is about that affects the immediate consumer daily cell so he has to press the daily he has to press so let's talk about the daily because it concerns our viewers it concerns us all the daily what is being done today we are talking about the wii compensation fund which of course supports the high cost of soaring raw materials not everything of course we do not have the resources
are for but that of great use consumption we take it first leblay million euros raised thann sugar billion billion energy mederic so we can not say that the government does nothing is what it does to these insects birth was this is the case for all the governments of the compensation fund which existed long before the government authorized besides it must help there are voices which have been raised for a few years now for it to be reformed forever
bear that's not part of the government's plan that's another story because even in the government's statement there is an allusion to this reform of the compensation fund absolutely the difference which has it is certain on gasoline and diesel is this that we will cap don't cap for the rest everyone agrees we will we will we will subsidize flour we will subsidize sugar we will be careful with honey we will be careful with the eyes we will everything that is clean
at a ramadan the lenses you think a cap is the initial rich the ramadan shield an inevitable solution i don't see any other solution in the media price caps all prices even those of diesel for me it doesn't seem like a trick it has been contradicted by the spokesperson for the government by saying there is no ground and there is no activating the activation of the economic watch committee was created to curb the crises is part of the same approach to the outbreak
aration of the government is that if I have to do this health coverage this social protection etc I cannot I do not have the means to do both of them a people he wants for the moment he does not want capped for the moment for the moment the members of the national council from lufc made a comment thats all that was dit's not to several comments first it is located in the comments finally we always talk about allusions we will see in politics and in situations
the same must have courage you think that it is real courage at the same time a timid if it is the stopping of the team in fact the ones he faces when we deal with very sensitive things be very very careful the proof hematology it must be required be very careful announced or that we found certain solutions which are not they will not solve the problem if you say that you are working besides I correct you do not have too much in the world perhaps you have three deadlines
s you said three mandates courtin medium term long term that's not worlds where the moment you have a single mandate you have just started it and you started it very badly very badly wanted to start very very badly the government does not start majority very badly it was the abyss government generally was elected on a very ambitious program that frankly we in the opposition in particular to him was made through the first secretary through our instances we said that it is
 impossible to carry out what was said at the time at the time before September because we saw all things being equal and the drought moreover I allow myself to tell you jobserve the water situation in certain regions of Morocco the drought is not does not date from today problems have been getting worse for four years for four years remember two years ago that's why he spoke of delays which are noted today a competition of projects there he my human
that we are moving the government and the former government forward I understand he said at the beginning we were in opposition the other responsible as soon as you return a government that a government is making a handover I am sorry for the Arctic and the liabilities and for the assets and liabilities of its more of time the more they work to catch up the more of your time the more that there has not been a big change in the configuration of this government the majority were present in the old government
rnment is directed the key positions he directed the key positions in this case finance finance and agriculture for ten or fifteen years so please come and say that that surprises us impossible to say that it had to be planned in terms of management of public resources it is necessary demonstrate economic intelligence  don't wait to get wet and in the rain you will have to go out first but here we would like to stay at a notary in Gaza or be less affected by the rain the b
oue switzerland to come back yes to come to a comment in relation to those to this government in its management of the crisis I just had friends on one thing the month of Ramadan is not really the station where the date I announce that the Moroccan will meet the Moroccan a meeting now so if you say that it's not serious and we talk and you allude to the safety stocks that we have we are going to touch it four years the accounts come to that it's serious secondly it's not only
nt the quantity is the prices already in years against it does not concern the normal Moroccan it is the improved diesel version but the one which is heavily consumed and the years why we talk about cap and the value in the station but there was a certain moment an exit from lestérel vacation we oppose me ministry of finance was to combine the mandate and we negotiated in means the derivative products for cap and the prices to say but what we see now for a premium is very careful
n what happened in the meantime or is it why it is not activated when it was not so that we are not activated has not been renewed said no we do not need an amending finance law for the moment but when will you are going to prepare it we are going there we are going to reinforce it have hours hours but it is impossible all the indicators are there the high price has failed we already have the crisis you wash the problems the problem people say is talking about raw materials this
st in a soc stated the introns they are finished and sometimes in raw materials are outside of us leaves us to transform we send back finished products we will increase the invoice we will value them but alnow you say it's because they are not sensitive she must rectify what I'm going to have to justify the budget of the coaches lawyer on the allowances what a finance law and managing a budget it's as simple as that it's the receipts dd no yes we remember the depends
its and I want the recipes we know them I go where they are simply reduced because for the reasons that we have removed it is an imported inflation rice and rolls also yes but suddenly when betty dd it is an imported inflation that must be stifled eye for you can how can't you sir you have imported inflation local inflation another nice offer a trade balance that will leave you further dug subject to the exchange agreement deficits and do
nc part of the five years and monetary in the suffer what will happen increase in interest rates and a liquidity crisis wanted more than that no to be the plank to say no no no that we have enough currency income not to create the basket to continue importing we managed from my car which is very low in their gold pension cover excuse me we are in the process of government reasoning to take two three times there it takes a sequence we were coming out of
 delta nobody had taken the comic rank and it was a question of the fourth quarter to make a relaunch the microphone to delay a policy of relaunch of the government or that's the philosophy of the beginning of this government's mandate there was but that's not what we expected this way progress towards the program you will god vote he is so socialist you should have voted this chasm walk around only lock to say it okay so repeat you is according to you know it
manage this I continue my demonstration the people who know how to manage this after after consulting them after intellectual and political humility after melon micron nobody saw this crisis coming it would be good if we really talked about a two-minute rest we would talk about the future that's what you're offering has become today is anyway the time is not on the balance sheet nor on decoys today the action the action that this government must take for imported inflation at the same that which is end
gene very well the government must as quickly as possible create a shield for the purchasing power of watches having financed it we finance it immediately by the deficit therefore debt crisis in the deficit by the debt the deficit always a piece of the debt by the debt palpa by the debt why why not the others we are going to talk why not austerity you said a very important sentence in value everyone is penalized today opposition as a majority and and e
st penalized so shouldn't we make a civilian effort old peak and you're doing a short term streak we're coming the world has just come out of a terrible crisis the economy was sluggish for two years manga want to breathe you can't reinject it austerity like sogespa austerity in luigi march budget simply operating if everyone has to pitch in is so decriminalizing the dausterity margin on the operating budget
ement is so reduced we can cut that we have them to solve the problem austerity on the functioning and vaulruz evening the solution is short-term debt that is to say we make an effort of debt how much on meu you have you have calculated that a base of billions it sells billions for what products to cover my basic necessities and funny yes yes very well a last word on the proposed solutions i first declare that the opposition no
very much the sfp and the solidarity on this point which is of national interest marie in our social eyes do not mark I hope you will we must be concrete a congruent and will do it must be done between green and concrete now the recourse to indebtedness they have no other choice it's not bad it's not bad to cover a very good but you have to be very smart you join the key whose source of indebtedness and its use his majesty had the benevolence to order
 to unlock they are from the hassan ii fund of billions which is one of the billions which was therefore a greatpart was assigned to the management of agricultural credit but with measures which certainly will not give anything because they are poorly oriented be very careful consult the government must consult the majority very well and the posterity risks for the people there that concrete solution for that yes a concrete solution therefore the debt you propose a little as erudite proud
The budget that you make requires the amending finance law for you it is inevitable inhabitat thank you very much Martine Aubry member of the national council of the SCFP is the word that thanks you and member of the savings alliance thank you also to you for all the tension lighting that is it end of access questions very quickly stops
the crisis in Ukraine has caused for the first time in Morocco that the price of diesel at the pump has exceeded that of gasoline  a situation which has repercussions on the prices of all foodstuffs in this month of Ramadan for many Moroccans including the court of income did not follow that of the prices of consumer products expressed their anger indicating that this surge in prices was unbearable the prices increased incredibly the high prices an unreasonable level are present
ts in all raw materials fruits vegetables fish all food products are very expensive the increase in prices not only affects the purchasing power of the citizens but also destroys and eliminates them nevertheless the citizens are patient and bear all these difficult conditions when you see that the booth today costs dirhams and the peppers all dirhams as well as the tomatoes all that and then the pockets of the citizens so pity for the Moroccan people although they
ue the government to reassure the supply of the national market during Ramadan the rise in prices of all products affects not only consumers but also traders the credit crisis it has a significant impact on prices and on Moroccan citizens before this crisis we used to buy food items at low prices and our profit was high but now i buy goods at very high prices which reduces our profit
fit and affected all traders directly impacted by the surge in fuel prices taxi drivers are worried this conflict has a great impact not only on Morocco but also on all countries in the world as for living in Morocco it has become very difficult when we have obligations and the children we must feed them clothe them provide for education and health needs may God help us to mitigate the impacts caused by the surge in fuel prices due to the crises
e in Ukraine gas prices and the price of bread remain subsidized by the state and exceptional support has just been launched for public and road transport professionals at the Riviera and Riffs command the Moroccan government is taking numerous measures to mitigate the rise in prices. ensures the support of a range of essential products in addition to supporting sports time professionals in order to maintain the pricing in force in public transport
common I think that this is an important measure of the government but it is not sufficient these procedures require global measures given that the support of professionals and insured to public professionals and not to drivers but they are an essential component of the collective transport system with sources of diversified supply from Argentina  Brazil  Canada and the announcement of an aid and support policy  Morocco hopes to cope well
 to the crisis
like everywhere else in the world  Moroccan companies are hit hard by the devastating effects of the coronavirus according to the general confederation of Moroccan companies more than companies are facing an increase in payment deadlines of at least days after the resumption the cgem which questioned among these member companies notes that more than half of them saw their activities drop by more than during the first three months of the year while
in others the slowdown in activities varies between and in addition a drop of more thanstill the investigation of the Moroccan employers especially in the sectors of the real estate of the tourism of the crafts of the cultural industries of the textile and the media the companies are due by the cgem fear the loss of more jobs or more of their workforce even if the Moroccan companies foresee a return to work from the month of June leu
r forecast turnover will be down for the rest of the year in the absence of visibility for the majority of foresees a recovery that for its part the Moroccan confederation of tpeme in particular activities for companies while are in partial stoppage because of the covid pandemic the business services and trade represent the sectors most affected by the health crisis with respectively nearly and a representative sample of the most
autoentrepreneurs are not spared either of them are out of business in the face of this situation the state reacts through a battery of measures  in particular through the actions carried out by the economic watch committee these measures are as follows suspension of the payment of social charges suspension of tax audits and notices attract holders and activation of daman oxygen the suspension of the payment of social charges until June concerns the establishment of an indemnity
nity of dirhamnet per month served by the coronavirus management fund to employees on sick leave affiliated with the cnss in addition to this the suspension of tax audits and notices attract holders until June also for all companies plus the economic watch committee also decided on measures to support the finances of companies in difficulty during this pandemic period  among other things  the establishment of a moratorium for the re
repayment of bank loan maturities and for the repayment of leasing maturities until June without payment of fees or penalties finally the activation of daman oxygenates an additional line of operating credit granted by the banks and guaranteed by the central guarantee fund for this bank financing covers up to three months of current operating expenses  in particular salaries  rents  necessary purchases and can go up to millions of d
irham for the case of companies that do not have a short-term line of financing  this exceptional overdraft can reach millions of dirhams more the economic watch committee has decided to set up a zero-rate loan for self-employed entrepreneurs affected by the crisis covid up to an amount of dirhams
this program is presented to you by theme wilcom Moroccan startups are developing by leaps and bounds leveraging innovation and creativity many achievements have been made by these young entrepreneurs whose major concern remains financing it is to respond to this problem that wilcom is doing financing of innovation  one of its main priorities  in order to fill the gap observed in terms of the supply of structured financing to support
 the creation and development of innovative start-ups thus the innovine jacket fund was launched as the result of an initiative of the ministry of economy and finance with funding raised from the world bank its design was thought out according to a participatory approach by listening to the other stakeholders  the idea being to set up a system capable of contributing to the revitalization of the Moroccan ecosystem of innovation as a whole  in particular through the label
isation of players with no less labeled structures and three public private venture capital funds structured start-up as part of the innovingvest fund an intervention targeted at the missing links in the ecosystem financing chain  particularly in terms of seed loan financing and capital ventures the innovinves fund is a sie that is gradually supported by private players in the ecosystem operating at different levels of the financing chain and
support for start-ups  including cluster accelerator incubator or even manager of capitalist funds according to several players the end launch of the innovine veste a c fundestablished a turning point for the ecosystem of startups in Morocco which previously experienced a low supply of structured financing  particularly for the very risky initial phases of launching innovative projects. Here are some figures to give an overview of the achievements of the innovinves fund over the last five years.
over the years more startups financed against an initial start-up objective more than millions of dirhams of private capital mobilized from local foreign investors in more than millions of dirhams in foreign currency more jobs created excluding startup founders and finally more patents filed are approximately patents of Moroccan origin this program was presented to you by Tom Wilcom
the reports from Bakel Maghreb on the monetary statistics which are monthly and whose February version was just released two days ago this report shows a deceleration in credit distribution for the second time  that is to say in January there is a drop in and it continues in February so the effects of this increase in the key rate how this can be seen of course the transmission times in a developing country are much longer than in developing countries
opposed to the iron of the non-integration of the markets of the financial markets but we must understand that in the process of executing a little the article of its mandate because the mandate is the stability of prices and that if tomorrow this inflation is set to perpetuate or last longer well we will all come back to this in this beautiful studio to criticize the problem the question that arises today is this increase in autodeactor sufficient in a landscape where there is a sort of I
 would say no recession there is no strong economic growth where there are structural reforms which are slow to be put in place in several areas of competition competition in the prices of storage distribution of food materials and the standard implementation place of these reforms of course attenuates or even cancels the impact of Baklmade's decisions
if the limit says it textually that the monetary instrument is not a solution to resolve the problem of inflation and by putting forward its own interpretation of this question of inflation by saying that it is a structural inflation and that Moroccans are invited to live with the element or the argument put forward essentially going beyond the limit to explain this inflation by supply essentially by saying that Moroccan agriculture does not produce enough good to meet the needs
less of the population so in other words he believes that it is an inflation by supply and of course at the basis of this reduction of course of the supply of goods provided by agriculture you of course have the increase in the cost of inputs do not forget that a good part of modern agriculture brings capital goods and of course phytosanitary products fertilizers from abroad which of course impacts the costs of these agricultural products then you also have at the level of the
modern culture there is a huge amount of investment which makes it cherished therefore no less consequences the products that we manage to produce at the level of agriculture cannot spread both to international demand because they will be exported by then but also for part of local demand

the current environment is characterized by we want to say a pile-up of crisis we have on the one hand the effect of the empty coc which is still with us in certain countries in particular china we have seen significant slowdowns there is obviously also the war in ukraine with the impact that this has on inflation rates  the prices of raw materials  energy and the price of food goods too and then of course we have a problem of inflation in a large part of the countries of the world linked to the fate
ie the pandemic in a context of supply chain disruption of high demand in certain countries and then fueled by the shock of war so these three factors lead to a situation where the global economy will slow down compared to what we anticipated at the time. month of April during our last cycle of projections and where inflation will still remain high and will lead to a tightening of monetary policies in a large number of countries so therefore we
We are obviously not anticipating the exact figures yet since we are in the process of doing our forecast cycle for our July update but it is already clear that the global economy is not necessarily going to grow at the percent which was our forecast for the month of April and that inflation will remain will remain a little more for the moment this is not our our central scenario but therefore scenario of slowdown slowdown but not necessarily global recession ma
we must still keep in mind a certain number of risk factors which are important so on the one hand we could have an additional installation of an additional escalation ddd sanctions and the war in Ukraine which would come which would put energy prices back under pressure perhaps the price of food goods we can also have inflation dynamics which are that they would continue to remain more persistently higher and which would spread more and that they
would require an even stronger recovery in even stronger tightening of monetary policies with an effect on growth so these two risks are very important there is a third risk which must nevertheless be kept in mind and that is that so far despite the tightening of monetary policies that we have witnessed the countries the financial conditions that i am talking about the conditions in drums of financing of the countries the conditions
s borrowing market access has been tight but but there has not been a major financial crisis or historically when the central monetary centers the united states europe the united kingdom and others enter a bullish cycle such as their monetary policy as now this creates difficulties for many emerging countries sarah leads to higher credit prices it also leads their currencies often to depreciate in these countries there are other problems of inflation im
scope of financing problems and therefore we are witnessing  in the past  situations where when the united states and other countries tighten their monetary policy this could cause quite complicated situations in emerging countries for the moment it has not yet happened but it must remain we must remain vigilant first of all for one of a large number of countries currently inflation has reached levels that are unacceptable even if the tightening of policies
s will lead to a slowdown in growth it is necessary to tighten monetary policy and stabilize prices the rise in prices and this stabilization of prices this is an important point I would like to clarify it will help growth by following because an environment which is a stable environment monetarily is an environment which is more conducive to growth which promotes financial stability and which livesnt also help the
 financing of public accounts so it is an adjustment that is absolutely necessary at this stage and a certain number of central banks have started to do it now for emerging countries which initially see part of their inflation linked to the depreciation of their currency this is not the case for morocco but also to a rise in the prices of imported materials  energy or foodstuffs so in general once again we can want to say goodbye to this inflation
we are not the cause salt is not linked to factors to ask to link them to imported goods so we can try to wait a little bit and homework but be careful because what we have seen in a number of countries over the last few months it is allowed that a dynamic of inflation which starts with raw materials energy the prices of imported goods and which then spreads to the rest of the economy becomes a much wider inflection and when it becomes an influence
much larger sision which is high at that time the central banks need to intervene and therefore we could in a certain number of emerging countries we have seen it with for example brazil we can think can think of mexico we can think of chile we can to think a certain number of emerging countries in asia there has also been the need to tighten monetary policy precisely because there is this transmission of imported goods to the rest of the consumer basket.
r and which can occur and which at that time does not leave room for monetary policy in the country who have the possibility there is a role for budgetary policy the increase in the share of energy prices and the price of goods food it strikes first and foremost the households with the highest incomes the most modest for them the share of energy and water and food in their eggs in the housewife's basket in their pain and their basket of their expenses
monthly income is very high and therefore this translates into a loss of purchasing power an impoverishment and therefore it is quite appropriate that governments through their budgetary policies come to support the come to help these most vulnerable categories we can also have situations where certain industries may find themselves in difficulty because it depends on a supply which will become more expensive  etc. and we do not necessarily want to lose part of the t
from industry so there may be support mechanisms also on the business side but it must be kept in mind that these measures need to be well targeted and they need to be as far as possible be temporary to really help and support in the times when it is necessary but not being part of a budgetary framework is longer so the difficulty often there is to put in place policies that will come to provide assistance q
which is necessary and without necessarily coming to burden the public accounts in an excessive way the lines are of those of which you speak of a line therefore a line of credit account which is called contingent which comes which allows the country to have access to resources when they need it with a form of prior agreement  that is to say that unlike two types of slightly more traditional financing that the IMF does when a country is already in difficulty and therefore comes
 see the imf to ask for help there a country can decide to put in place conditional aid in advance which would be there if ever certain risks materialize so what this obviously requires a discussion between the authorities of the country and the imf on the few granting conditions in advance of this help so a certain number of criteria which are discussed etc I will not go into details because these discussions are in progress but it brings the principle is that it comes after
bring additional flexibility to these countries to enable them to deal with a certain number of liquidity shocks that they would have to face in the future

here is sir good evening on the menu two current questions this evening entrepreneurship in Morocco in the light of initiatives such as crazy that where its big sister intel has taken to the heart of the recommendations of the new development model for equal opportunities and although the very small business constitutes in essential number of Moroccan entrepreneurial fabric why public policies for entrepreneurship do not achieve their objective pub support some will say but is this the role
Does a banking institution have the necessary resources capable of bringing a young person to the status of entrepreneur with a flourishing business or a business plan? In any case  others will point out the poor management of the state of support programs  how can we then optimize the millions released to make entrepreneurship an alternative? viable and reliable for brown employment in tizi ntlata or the very last force what are the flaws of these programs how to capitalize on its
errors to function the future approaches and teaching in all this why inculcate the mind this entrepreneurship does not appear in curricula from a very young age although this ambition has been displayed by many governments when can we aspire to be champions of entrepreneurship then that the observation is unequivocal the small Moroccan company has a tiny margin of maneuver to survive our young shoots can they wait longer for a sta
decent social tut topical questions that we will ask this evening to two experts have evening blade up he can't wait they played while writing are therefore international consultant in management tour we are going to talk about management today whether it is management of the company or management of a entrepreneurial program with your welcome to this plateau thank you very much for the invitation and I have a renewed pleasure to welcome by skype youssef naceri analysts economists good evening Mr. naceri me
thank you for joining us good evening from higelin and thank you for the changes if we stick to the figures of the man of the man pic to the figures of business creations in Morocco of new businesses in Morocco an exceptional rebound in will be ready the year that quickly it is a bit logical and is normal but why this reference gentlemen shows in terms of business creation is not really indicative of the good health of the Moroccan entrepreneurial fabric the question is open who wants to take
e the lead candidate and I can tell you that it is a very good figure which is taken in isolation and it is a breath of fresh air to say that we have created so many companies but personally it is not my specialty I know a lot of people who have companies in the drawers that is to say those of the status milan because I gave up last year so that would be good is to always follow up on the first five years which worldwide is the period where at least half
  will disappear and even in developed countries where there is no problem of support for access to financing and the bases and generally in North America which I know very well just to bring a good business plan and yousee the financing you can choose the bank you are spoiled for choice because it is in finance the ideas we are not loan sharks in a trio but to take real guarantees very well a reaction he was threatened before attacking the programs
my support from entrepreneurship in general a lot of companies are going out of business this is not specific to Morocco but the situation in Morocco is a little more critical compared to other countries I completely agree and I would like to say something about this figure on this figure the number of creations per year that for me I see it in our susan eng this is the angle that the Moroccan and the Moroccans' ready to undertake he is ready for my emails slow adventures
repreneurship that's how my pretty this significant and interesting increase in business creation it's true that the mortality rate is there it's another question the mortality rate and helping them and the enormous ones in Morocco by a comparison comparison with the number of programs and of support and policy that says that we are in the process of supporting the entry of small or very small businesses in general so for me the mortality rate price without taking into account
of these multitudes of programs that exist I would say that it is in the world average how to say but it is certain but seen on this site last ten years we see dozens of programs which are put in place whether it is financing or aid at the start and despite that we are unable to stop this hemorrhage of business closures according to you the question is not really about creating new businesses but keeping them alive ultimately so precisely
nt since we are talking about observations let's talk about mokraoui lati first we will perhaps proceed in chronological order moukawalati it is a bit the parent of other initiatives such as crazy that we will get there and of course a telara we will also talk about it why it is a failure because well the question arises but you are a failure or a success but why it was a failure and what are the faults are these faults there we finally determined them with a lot of hindsight to accept a pr
problem of behavior already of people who took the credit with the money and that it refers as a lover to education and teaching I would not like to leave the subject but today we have a large project which is led by a gentleman who personally inspires me a lot Trust Mr. Jacques Benmoussa to work on education and rationing and in depth instead of blurring the surface that we used to do and what is the link between what I have just said
the significant correlation with entrepreneurship personally and sorry my specialty I know a lot of people who have joined in the program is stopped we could go up to three associates each have what team and a good mechanical workshop I know people who were of the two propellers is in an area that is irrigated so they did not stop working but when they got rich as there was no support they left to open each
a studio so success in the said in the profession dedicated to continue they abandoned the common project because he could no longer get along so the state here it hurt if everyone put enough into their account and they never received the two writers did not repay key hurts including teens who is a problem with repayment and credit recovery that has not been operated exact or downright exactly time never get his money back and the majority of project
t had not failed in terms of functioning it is the idea that one can have exactly it is the games have not been reimbursed because the relationship with money when one has a problem of education and teaching it has been verified how life says just now behind the scenes even in france when there was the idea of ​​network entrepreneurship morocco someone who has a lot of hindsight who has a great entrepreneur he said it's against the we start to earn money with the equivalent of one hundred thousand dirhams that
the problem begins and does not end he was the only one to underline this thesis so he said we are going to appeal to the greatpublic who are the entrepreneurs the great journalists university professors who know entrepreneurship who can each support three or four people over a year but the program is spread over months if you are a total success we were talking about the network entrepreneurship Morocco which is who and I would not say a subsidiary but who globally affiliated with the network in
treprendre from France which is spread out in several countries around the world its success does not come from the equivalent of ten thousand euros which I gave the fact that there is a mentor an accompanist that the person receives every fortnight and who is even a right of inspection on the account because when you see that there are a lot of recipes for example an ironworker he starts to sell he knows two or three architects because his mentor will tell him if you do artistic ironwork if
you don't talk to the dice zaïna legrand architecture has difficulty hitting the ports of the big developers to sell that when we start to come back that's where the problem is they will invest far from the company buy land apartments in front of the sea of ​​cars oversized in relation to their financial standing and it is therefore the gentleman he was the only one to see correctly he said the support and the support we will we will certainly talk about these dac methodology
support that we are optimal but before they know naceri we are talking today about int and art with a mixed record without having we have figures we have some fairly telling figures company since its launch so in February by his majesty the king it makes sense of course it's a program that is supposed to support we put a lot of emphasis on the company because before financing it will be necessary to support and after having financed it will be necessary to support that's where the problem can be.
tell us about this program intel has not perhaps also a word on moukawalati in complementarity to what was developed by ten the ati in complementarity I would say that the failure of the moukawalati and monetics program is due mainly to the choice of profiles of people a large part of these a good part of these young entrepreneurs at the time did not have broad enough shoulders and did not have the entrepreneurial spirit so we chose good ideas it's true we chose p
projects that could work but we did not focus on the profile of the entrepreneur because today with all the good will in the world if we even have an innovative idea but if we have if we do not have the stature of a real entrepreneur at that time it is It's difficult to guarantee the sustainability of the company and of course look at that  it's going in the right direction because people instead of investing in production tools or working tools they invested i
They invested elsewhere and hence the monumental failure on the other hand I believe that the word camoletti was a victim of the success of the show the challengers which was in a legacy channel launched in a public channel because the people were much more in the appearance and was not in the work and is much funnier to appear competition I too I did just I benefited from a deer created to hurry from it was a thanks to a program which was a success so a little bit we
 did not work did not work the human we had gone much more on the on the love whose time we will encourage entrepreneurship but this for all that choose the good entrepreneurs its tithe not to speak of enlarged doubt believe that you are the breakage was for me it was a very very good program and still but what is missing there are two phases in my opinion there is in the first phase which was oxygen at the time of the launch at that time it is you remember there was we were in full cry
se at the start of the crest of crisis incubates yb so it needed a breath of fresh air for the young people and for the company in general so it was a good start so there was a fairly rigorous selection subsequently there was such aa the startup everything is there in my humble opinion a man's life due to the fact that I am full of vimont a work of expert in entrepreneurship the startup was very good because there was a real selection of projects a real se
electione profiles and there was some of the accompanying goal but afterwards we don't know what happened the boks rushed to the quantity is so we had gone and towards the goal it became soviet figures how much to create there was this competition between the banks how much to lend there to each bank had given to serve as communication responds servide and at that time the problems began with the lack of with the absence of repayment and the lab
sence of reimbursement I believe more than one point that ace cannes did not take into account is that it was a credit that was given in the middle of a crisis these tasty start this frame that you had to go if you allow your mind you had to give a real delirium you had to give a real deadline to start a real sample to redial them repay his credits once the deadline is over from the banks they took off the headset is social and societal they started asking for their money whatever
 part they are right but that's what that's the project that was not conclusive well designed in duplicate what they want I would just like to add is that people the world is talking montella spoke for his part of man's shares in wells we forget that there to other programs as important as from the points of view volume of funding or that two points of view volume number of beneficiaries these programs is celine h there is what is in its third to its third phase which accompanied hundreds of
thousands of people I speak in entrepreneurship so the start it was we have an income-generating activity it's small agr small cooperatives small small trades has been supporting since the since its start there are also programs we also read programs that they want launched by the ministry of crafts for the launch of what stirs adam and everything that stirs annie analysis there is a program that is launched by the ministry of agriculture that the
s generics which is in its if young project leaders in the field of art and culture there are funding programs in its shares morocco pim and the liter of milk ministry of industry of industry there are programs launched by the ministry of youth and sports to partly encourage sports entrepreneurship and lately there is even a mini program launched by the ministry of culture to encourage all that is cultural entrepreneur so we will who
there are multitudes of programs whether in number of the budget and the carers and the number of beneficiaries it is much more important it is above all by the adjustment precisely these nacelles and certainly there are many programs game precisely stopped on interior when I return with you on intel not before we move on for some and it was reported in particular on social networks and word of mouth that the money that was contracted through the meadows of
e tera was disbursed because you spoke at the beginning when we were talking about moore finally you mention moukawalati of you speak of the stature of a real entrepreneur was used by other takers entrepreneurs who already do not exist in the making and who used this money there to acquire luxury cars well in any case cars or to buy that is to say for us this money was not used to create wealth and value ultimately we put that it was
two telara corporals I believe that the lawsuit that happens to you cult work and the breakage and that it is reassembled a cd resale and which were raised it is sometimes it is an entrepreneur who contracts and wise and this return there through a banker it is an entrepreneur who contracted the loan through his wife to use it for the cash flow of his business which you rightly mentioned suffered collateral damage from the kovy and I pass the examples are multiple  that is to say that the g
ym net that it's not a question of the entrepreneurial spirit it's it's it's entrepreneurs or even seasoned me who find that was the proof it's a way to have liquidity quite simply that's what you said Mrs. dun prodigious I'm completely done okay but it was for a part it was for a part of young people generalize not far from me the idea of ​​generaliser but I am I know but I contact with work that in this context with two banks this is the pr
first banker cc is credit and interest there is a bank which has a support structure and art i can assure you that they manage to succeed in these projects and guarantee reimbursement europe what is happening to you and when i said earlier it's only when we moved on to having when we moved on to the objective of figures and I say of Soviet Cyprus how the most important thing is how many projects we financed and which succeeded and which became sustainable but the objective
if but after two years or else talking about the success of a project got tight I'm talking about sustainability I thought I even wanted the sustainability of saying in the life of a company what is month what is twelve months it's just the beating the stay and so we can talk about success and mistakes and me if I'm wrong I'm not an entrepreneur well listen we are full with small business in general for us a very small business that starts the cases manage to pass the course
 the first years for us are a success because these are the most critical years so we can't really take stock of intel has not today and the ati says no why did you say so yourself globally I follow a lot of statistics and of benchmark we take stock after at least years and after five years even in the developed world nature we do not see it but indeed our dear to whom associates so they approve that here is even to the studies
united ats after years half of the companies disappear and we must not have any illusions why not what it is not everyone who can become an entrepreneur even if he has a baccalaureate in entrepreneurship marking every time i say it i start to receive blows everywhere why because behind the state of mind there is also a state of health many people settle in activities where the commercial turmoil is so great whereas if there had been a
 health check we tell them don't go where there are a lot of variations of moods where there are a lot of local trips we manage to follow them take I don't visualize your exact and I imagine that if I visualize the game I work I worked in a canadian program for two years we support people promoter canadian version we did a health check-up for the able-bodied person why because regions with very advanced diabetes and who want to do
 an activity where they have to do sales all day in the field no we don't give you ten thousand dollars because it's going to be thrown out the window you can be a graphic designer in an air-conditioned office day and someone else will do the sales for you you see how retail in europe and one of those programs is called loan circles it was a thousand dollar loan to are secured but most importantly again i'm obsessed with the word
if he does not accept that a volunteer entrepreneur and we slip from them by their volunteering the others talk about the marquise I consulted their website yesterday the other from the entrepreneur he pays three thousand dirhams to become volunteer mentors it makes you laugh three thousand dirhams to help and for months he said I can only accompany anyone because maybe he has a financial fiber he will accompany them on the financial part why because they have created projects that we
t link with finance someone else commercial someone else logistics and operations will hesitate years basically end not wholesale but implicitly it is not the role of the banks and semmaris unfortunately is it the banks that must support during projects that weren't expected we're going to be really down to earth the banks already by financing through I'm not even sure if it's the cost of money with inflation so it's not for
defend the basins a pardon we will come to it facing sedan so they tare you a little less for the rural world it's not even the cost of money with these times if we also add to them that they have to recruit people it's loads fixed and that they mustto see offices and facilities to support it is not their role if the ministry in charge of the prime minister's office and the program that must do this work with public money very well a reaction to the
on top before talking about guardianship precisely young people interested in the role of who fulfills responsibilities you said that you work with two local banks and who has one that stands out precisely thanks to a program that is really targeted to support the project leaders but what is the role of the bank is a bit short for participatory science in the projects tell me the role of the bank is not to insure under the company where we want to insure a party
e of the accompaniment in close collaboration with all the actors who can them to all the actors who had to do d who had to do the accompaniment I give you a simple example two dennahda marriage of the bank with the program to initiate the india program that is to say that the bank provides part of the financial support and does not support it or the company's financial and Monday hours and there on support on everything that came out it on everything that is good this plan on everything
 what are the postures of the entrepreneur at that time it is a complete this game it is a complementarity there was wind which set up structures in different regions of morocco which provide support from a to z milan it is not it is not investments lost because these entrepreneurs he deposits elise open trend accounts is good so time and gall also beyond tottenham and i believe not to say but i will make sure of this information is that the b
anque it bears the bank does not bear I alone do not bear the cost of such a case there is also a part borne by therefore the bank somewhere they bear but the rest and the countries I believe by donkey marc lieb to the banks but I will make sure of those there the difference but in any case a difference which is clear today so that we move on to the news which is fossat program the program is then that will have been reviewed at you just have to remember it will be relaunched s
ur new bases pending of course the balance sheet although the balance sheet before years is what we can really take into account the minister announced that the monitoring committee will meet again with representatives of the banking sector in the coming weeks to draw the conclusions of the results of the enterprise program in the means to renovate it just in parentheses so we will wait maybe maybe that but the difference between ntela prat and understand the context of the lancem
ent of such a withdrawal and that of convict even before basing itself to capitalize on the successes and the errors of telara it is that today we have a ministry in charge of the economic insertion of the very small company and employment so you spoke just now of the role of guardianship is it not also of the role of this guardianship to accompany a this kind of program a reaction a deal to athies spaces to you too completely because if it's called like you
have founded the ministry of the tpe me I stay on it why because in the whole world have in turn the author of to companies all over the world his debts p to what multinationals you can count me on the fingertips in each series no this is the case this is it for example if such an attack remain constructive it is necessary as if national had well underlined to start by extending the period of franchise why because we have just come out of a pandemic we are
 in the gray before becoming white you have to give people a breath of fresh air instead of pretending six months free period it can even go up to months but on a case-by-case basis you shouldn't generalize that because it's people who start to have immediate income for example someone who has a café or a restaurant he has immediate income and he if he is intelligent he can pay his suppliers every day why give him the father
de francis de mois it would even encourage him to have bad behavior with money which accumulates very well and therefore to a word on the role of guardianship and thatand I am talking about supervision I am of course talking about the ministry of integration hours of economic inclusion pardon of small business of employment and skills I believe that the role of this ministry is very important and for me the best role is to play a coordinator role has a program coordinator role
s which exist because as we only have one day it's funny like a tablecloth with several people so you what each time in concert a program to give to our organization which is completely completely different and moreover talking about the week I'm talking about the smit I speaks of the others of the other programs I speak of my mainly of the smit knowing that the smit we remember that at the time of the water uncle a piano pando m kovy she had launched a program for the other in the d
tourist area and until today I believe that people have already closed the door so we are already leaving an experience which experienced a total failure and to begin a new experience which is generalized to all sectors and not just to its sector of activity par excellence so for you to come back to the supervisory ministry I believe that it had to play an important role in coordinating the programs that exist and God knows how many support programs there are
 in Morocco there are support programs that they must take care of which are carried out by some private banks in the place there are banks there are programs which are carried out by the world bank in different regions of Morocco and the hands program these are the words my god there are programs which this fruit which are done by the ministry of one of the two the mystery of industry via marc viénot SME the national agency for the promotion of the support of medium and small businesses there are
  programs so I believe that if we had a coordinating body for this program to make them complementary and later talking about the lifespan of the company we say that the first three years and are critical from years have guaranteed the sustainability of the company why don't we put programs it's true that there are two small Tibbitt acceleration programs but why don't we put programs that intervene along the
 duration of the life of the small business of the programs which are in pre-creation in post-creation and after creation up to months and our program which will take over the business from months to years and from years to years that is what is done elsewhere the good friend was said there talking about canada which he also knows very well there are programs which are specific according to the age of the company and we are talking about acceleration now talking about acceleration hagenau of an acceleration us it is
 the acceleration there we integrate the digital it integrates the intelligence and economics of which the eco companies empty and dismiss on what I always say that we empty was a huge opportunity to catch up and make a real assessment is therefore to my of a new ERP but unfortunately we came back we came back because the launches you think that the strong launch that it was not a little hasty when I say hasty it is first to make a pre-assessment on such a purchase before launching with a new
water program is ours budget allocated to this program exactly so sure when you said there had to be there had to be a review of a tea there there had to be a review of Monday age and that I believe there was in to do the evaluation of the third of the third phase and it was also it was hasty because only this week we have just learned that the eldest half of the regions where the tender was and unsuccessful exits for the incubators will not be canceled
 on the other hand and this is for me the most the most the most critical the most dangerous point is that to date there is no framework contract between the smit and the microcredit organizations because the donkeys people responded to the call for tenders there was affectionate so we are starting a program without having incubators in several regions without having a framework contract with micro credits  including for the moment those who are assigned to it and cannot have money because there is no
no microcredit organization that agreedwith lake milan that's it and indeed the the moroccan tourism engineering company is what you think it's once again proof that it's a bad choice to pilot the program if you can just repeat there was a cut of his young prodigy years old do you think that the choice of the smit was good  in particular to pilot this program on the basis of what you told us at the moment not at all not at all
 there this meeting he hasn't even done the gifted fads of the funding program for project leaders in the tourism sector there are the binders less than years of years and giving him gives him adds a program and why in donations to the result while there is an organization there is a supervisory ministry with several organizations and agencies that can do what they are on the who are in the field if I had for example there is one reads there at lanapec who work in the
employability will go parties work in entrepreneurship i would have liked it to be in peace i would have liked it to be the ministry of the interior via the regional investment center who have a guinea program the role today of the series and the tooth ben to date there I believe that the series I don't have a very clear idea because the program in saying all is not clear but I believe that they will play the role of incubators or support premises in
ur role but I don't have a clear idea what the series will do because the sequel and the launch of a call for tenders to recruit a pursuit helping at least two incubators per region if not one incubator per city and half of this call for tenders and the unsuccessful outings so for me if there are incubators it is a digital platform of nerves line for the winged entrepreneurs I do not see that what the series will do in addition so for me it was this point there is not clear
re julie i was spending my america on it the role of may for the for the tenders on the selection of financing companies he was an unsuccessful freak according to the forum so we know that a hundred thousand ago today applications submitted via the portal force to the point and my so it's sure his he must he of they must now wait for an agreement to be signed between the smit and the microcredit and that's targeting a little bit of this place because instead of the organizations
 microcredit now it is the smit which has its hands tied because it has already launched the forçat program and therefore the microcredit organizations they will find themselves in a position of strength to negotiate to increase their share of conditions by one ter and their share of interests in this program and they are right because they are for-profit companies so he must seek the land the their interest but it is at the smit it is following who must answer why we years in the program when
 kill elements are not are not ready yet on the one hand on the other hand incubators are not ready the funding is not is not yet is not yet ready we are launching a program and still there is a very dangerous point in the launch of progress in france that's that we called on fluence hours I'm not against influences there but I'm talking about being influenced as a profession today of influencers it's a profession that is inside to inform it because it
is because will say dtaxes here they remove that they are in front but that's what I say they are informal so how at the time of the launch the smit or the bodies notice who is there he has unfortunately under-processed the launch campaign and the campaign from camp they are going to pay we bring people back to television we bring people back social networks who are in the informal to set up a fake breasts a program which are so helping people to migrate from the informal berlin formulate do
nc i personally can't assimilate this this point makes it barely an informal to encourage people to go from informal to offer to train so there are several several points unfortunately which is which indicates that the background dams that and the hands gone we will certainly receive this week the director who could not be with me it is clear that we have for a concern of course of fairness we washs invited but could not free himself to be with us today
today we will certainly receive her and ask her questions the director of the crazy program that since you spoke of how many million dirhams is that a lot for the com of a program such as crazy that and since you spoke of influencers these same site journalists electronics who decried and who criticized the fact of having used influencers for the launch of x that well we find the convict advertising on these sites and therefore more more personal
I don't criticize I say that I would say but it's the truth today it's Nathalie a reaction build on it allow me to add a single point on this report not complete go to senna sorry if reserved so I would say that a public state institutional program does not need this way of communicating and it just took a few spots on TV we have three we are increasing public TV here we will play four public aids in Morocco today ely has more this ch
television elder both of them who are part of the east of the crt and which covers all listening covers all categories of people either on the one hand on the other hand we are inclined to rama doyon it is that the percentage of audience after a dal maghrib and the enormous then it We just needed an advertising spot and the facts and we will have the facts without losing because you spoke of four million dirhams is largely knots million on what they represented that of the budget t
otal force with the financing the support is logical exactly so it took a few television and radio spots and on the radio for us to arrive at another objective of the proof is that the real joint campaign in Zion does not yet started and we already have a hundred thousand files filed a hundred thousand on our backs and necks it's good no it's a good thing getting involved that's what I'm saying it's a very good thing but before the launch of the real communication campaign
nication planned and I believe that they owe it to them to take this telephone into account but even without really understanding what it is about above all he is eager to be a word on his millions at the level of young people too millions I assure them of communication I should perhaps I would have used three million dirhams for communication a few spots as if our life had said it well we today have ten times more the number we want we want ten thousand companies have a hundred thousand requests and the
wines and the millions I will not see used using the installations just to facilitate the installations of the regions for the sailboats of the experts who will accompany the people through serial training so that they have the technical part and I would have used but me with a little hindsight I would have used the ministry of tp of inclusion to manage this program this program and I let the ministry of tourism manage its serious tourism problems and that they are global and here in Morocco
 we have no visibility in terms of tourism and now the minister is experiencing a sort of distortion and diversion because the tourism problems are there we no longer had hotels which were at a standstill in Marrakech today we are starting to help them but we are playing the role of a firefighter manager without visibility without strategy but we find a way to give him another program and to also get angry with a minis
be that not hidden in the press which the ministry of the tpe which could have used morocco SME and the regional facilities to support the people because for me men vauquelin accompanied the people because we have education problems and serious teaching problems and no one wants to recognize it and every time it is said and they tell me you are negative no I am realistic quite simply I am recognized in words about it perhaps something to add yes jaj
only that it is true that with the expertise capitalizing on the SME brand it would have been a very good start and and it can even predict a success it can predict between if I also add that in my opinion we did not even need to launch a call for tenders for the to have private sector incubators and associatesations of the fact that we have that we have a nursery of premises and that they are ready I know them personally and are ready to join these types of programs which are the chambers of
e commerce and industry that exist in each city and that have premises to house this type of incubation tube  not to mention we're not going without talking about two and a half months of occupation I don't know how we're going to be able to incubate in two and a half months at people who were who have never talked about entrepreneurship and we're going to talk to them about entrepreneurship and a cube and in two and a half months that's another question that we have to ask Madame qualifies as a cube and people have had it in just
two less less young especially I will not fail to ask them thank you on the other hand can be so hard I receive hundreds of calls from young people who want to have information on fossat and he just asks me do they have to take care of leo no personally judic no if the hatred for a project leader who does not yet have his game structure  the young person directs either towards the regional investment center or towards h in the sense that I give a simple example on Monday to that created and fi
nanced cooperatives up to mg with lost funds by the purchase of equipment and there it is also an action does not give money but we buy equipment and for individuals financing can go up to mg at fountain and imagine the first line report h we do not the most thumbs who are unable to survive beyond beyond a year and a half two years therefore with lost funds with support and the project leader is unable to survive by giving a year and a half
so what about a young person who is going to receive money on loan so there will be repayments after a question to ask a lot of questions about his he only raises questions so went in my opinion we should have we should have stayed this supervision of the ministry of economic inclusion  we should have involved partners such as chambers of commerce and we will save more than hundreds of millions of dirhams  including one in the operation and its hundreds of millions
dirhams united will go to increase the premium in the hérault to young carriers and especially for the recruitment of real advisers and real experts in entrepreneurship because unfortunately unfortunately nowadays we find people who have never seen companies who have never rubbed shoulders with an entrepreneur and they are and never start a business eos in the process of supporting entrepreneurs so I believe there is a mistake like computer scientists somewhere somewhere
leave here and that's the point the crucial point the crucial point in the programs this is the high pillar of success this is what this guide and his convincing mentor have signed  chosen because unfortunately it is said that because of a lack of budget we are heading towards junior advisers in part to bit au advisers but here we are compromising an entire program to save a few cents in the same way as parallels yes recognizes betting a few hundredths I d
would go a little a few hundred thousand dirhams maybe yes me personally I still don't believe my specialty in strategy the stairs are cleaned from the top already there are two ministers who are not on the same wavelength and all that has filtered into the press and in terms that are not always pleasant the Ministry of Tourism and he is in charge of a sector that has been badly affected worldwide and which must restart I think that this song which will take him at least
next three years to be straightened out this strong program and without complex they must be repatriated to the ministry of the tpe which must use the money of the communication for country ten experts who therefore go to the regions it feels that it has already been older the goods have already been signed we will go from there use the offices of the regions and the chambers of commerce so as not to have a lot of unnecessary charges and go towards monthly support and for the Latins to save it
must extend the period of franchise everything is repairable if there is a political will etc people drag down their ego even as a minister repatriates a program because our ministry is going to lirelieve the Minister of Tourism to work on a very devastated site the hotels are at a standstill in Marrakech and Agadir and she is going to do this for the young people she first takes care of her basic function before extending her functions sheet very well is there
  other flaws according to you on this program strength just spoke maybe there is an honor loan what is a mg honor loan what is its thousand dirhams are guaranteed without interest yells at me when I get ten thousand dirhams to keep and and and a rate of interest therefore it is non-negotiable by the microfinance organizations a toad it is not with an interest rate at the same it is not as such at the interest rate it will be borne by the state so for the beneficiaries not the
s beneficiaries and by their beneficiaries yes for the beneficiary but this is where he will bear the totality of the interests of two secrets very well but according to you do you think of its limits there of these data on the credit to and the billions listen it is if we guarantee real support with real entrepreneurship advisors with real experts I believe that we will be able to ensure part of part of the first step to go back up from the first
 is it working is what is it that already financing organizations with the failure and incubators is the deadline at the end and realistic and achievable no it is well I believe that microcredit now they are in a position of strength so they will be able to negotiate negotiate more and without intervention without intervention I believe from the high authority I believe that the agreement is not is not for tomorrow so in my opinion this deadline cannot be difficult to difficult to achieve
on the one hand on the other hand let's not forget that we are that with the void there was this war which made all the raw materials and logistics expensive in the world so I believe that we had to review the figure of a thousand dirhams to give to entrepreneurs the cost energy was born and the elders and the very high today today in Morocco comparison comparison with others with other countries the same between two levels of development the cost of the raw material flesh and
logistics and therefore I believe that many question marks arise on the amount of one hundred thousand dirhams that will be done for a real entrepreneur in particular we speak that my courage and having innovative ideas we want to have projects relatively in the field of industry I I think it's going to be something very difficult  so gentlemen  if you allow me  to finish this show  perhaps a few small elements as I said in my introduction even if it's not
 our role but indeed it is our role to question government programs that is democracy is that first you said that everything was recoverable whether for the dollar everything is not repairable is recoverable and I could say recoverable because it is not yet launched for force has therefore caught up by recovering what are the elements in order to you have cited some of them and in particular for the use of two already existing structures of the communication chamber
thank you and so on what are the other elements that you see important before really launching because there is one the effects announced it had the announced effect of fossa but the effective launch of times that a small parenthesis for example by such an attack it is necessary to extend the period of frankness instead of talking about a country because we have just come out of two years of pandemic and now there is the horsehair war which has upset all the data and with that we are going to give a
oxygen to people so that they can repay before establishing statistics perhaps they are wrong and the support all have an element we can use the facilities which are free in the chambers of commerce and in the regions to send experts every fortnight to do perhaps a Sunday from h to h or from h to h capsules with people except that they have the technical part to force nothing is lost yet forced he should have started with an oral pitch
This is what the network does. It still makes no effort not to exclude people who do notcan't go on an application to scold the carpenters cd ferronickel its excellence it's the women who work from home and who will talk about women an exodus is precisely this program for that is intended for women and the inclusion of women in the formal economic fabric there the problem yes of the inclusion of women in the economic fabric is that most wind in the formless
l in the endorsement and but instead of sending people back to the app it's easy but for someone like tina fey hasn't done a lot of studies and he's going to go to a cyber yade is less and less cyber so how is he going to go to the app for to fill six years nice au m would have three hundred thousand if we had made a pitch in the form of a video we in minutes and we do it in many countries we don't have anyone talking very comfortable to present his project a woman who knows how to do
e embroidery etc she will even show examples five minutes is more than enough they can limit the video to minutes at the level of the strong accompaniment that we can always catch up with it and very quickly using free facilities once again chambers of commerce and of the two regions because they have a role to play and send experts and all that I think the leak is not for that we know insisted on the real ones relying still necessarily busy but
 she is there she has expertise and successes that are accumulated human resources that are paid by taxpayers money youssef naceri the role of civil society to conclude or maybe another fine tuning element like the long as presented or in addition  has there been a deadline for me for me if we really want to succeed in succeeding with entrepreneurs and young people I say it I say it again I will be repeating it we must have complete programs
 banking and for me cold it would have been a huge chance to succeed if he had come to complete one of the programs that already exist a simple example of complicity in a sure and sure forecast but this day at o'clock it's just a yodel with the winged with the regional center of investment today at risk they their new vocations which have begun to take an interest in heaven in entrepreneurship and in very small scale enterprises they have programs he launches calls for demonstrations
interest call for projects they receive hundreds if not thousands of young people and sometimes they receive games with a very good profile to be undertaken  but the blockage that they know is to stop these young people is that they do not have the personal contribution of their on the one hand and it is for those who manage to have the three points are and not they do not manage to have a rent rent a room to receive the equipment so imagining today it is strong that and the comings
s to finance the door of years and finance the working capital to have to rent from to month for this young entrepreneur believe me the number of the number of beneficiaries and not been since tripled with its programs just with the two programs that I know very well from monday pm and is neutral to the world bank program and to buy investment centers and gyan there one would have tripled the member and even perhaps reached a number much more than that fixed by sometimes that they
 just came a program that does i want to say it does the same thing and even it does less because in india is there two hundred thousand dirhams wasted through the purchase of equipment the beautiful thing for the investment center the same thing for the banks in a word  how can I say the same thing so that foreign international cooperation cooperation that exists in Morocco without quoting without soliciting there is in me if foreign cooperation via their embassies that make the
 same thing and which affects all sectors which affect all sectors and all categories of young people of course when I speak of young people there is also the woman there is also the end there is even foreign cooperation which interests us only in the case of the entrepreneur a female minard imagine these convicts imagine strove has become for for to remedy the problems from up there so many personnel that the young entrepreneur must have I guarantee you and I say it loud and clearrt we would have trip
lé the number of pros of two young people and young people who have the entrepreneurial spirit and we are going to bring back a program for me I repeat I repeat it do that it is a program of troops here the idea is clear on the one hand it is to choose the good one the good institution to oversee this program for the ca so that it can succeed uruguay is there with ty and youssef naceri who insists on this idea of ​​high place quite simply to have several programs to have several but with a vision
 transverse thank you very much gentlemen thank you many questions remain unanswered and as I am the professionals they will be asked to whom it may concern thank you to villa enough thank you to his nature you are here it is the end price stendhal was very good evening to all head
  Africa from the point of view of economic intelligence was for a very long time a continent which was behind because there was no organization which developed which made aware of economic intelligence and there was too slow no will either at the level of the countries this is the big news for years because now there are all the economic intelligence bodies and organizations which are set up in most African countries the leaders of the African countries
Americans have understood the interest of economic intelligence to build winning policies and from that moment on therefore things are in the process of exchange and in my opinion rather quickly today's meeting by lamp shows that there is a real mobilization on the theme of economic intelligence which was inconceivable just five or ten years ago so it's a big step forward and we should be happy about it because I think that in the complexity of current problems economic intelligence
 is one of the keys to getting by in global competition but also in the difficulties which have almost everywhere down Morocco positioned itself in economic intelligence very early before the others as a leader when I said earlier the French Africa is a continent where economic intelligence has been little practiced but for about a year here in Morocco we have been practicing economic intelligence at the state level at the level of certain state services and references
the examinations which are made there is work in the universities so we have we have had a big evolution for everything for years now so it is normal that in the framework now of an African desire to create an African economic intelligence taking into account the specificities of African countries It is logical that it is happening in Morocco because Morocco is ahead of the others so it is logical that it is happening around Morocco and I am delighted because it is today when we
it all the people who came to participate in the congress it shows that this is it we have reached a very important milestone thanks to the work that is done by the Moroccans because they are the ones who pushed the whole world and the challenges to overcome if you want there are several gifts first of all it is to face reality because one of the big problems that we have in many countries in Africa but also elsewhere the big problem is to look at ourselves as we are and not as we believe
  that we are it is very important it is necessary and economic intelligence has the merit of leading us to be realistic  that is to say to look at the situation as it is with its faults with its qualities its strengths and weaknesses and from there therefore to be able to construct political options economic options which allow development so today Monday the practice of economic intelligence the start we can say of the practice of economic intelligence will lead to progress
ively I think the countries and the leaders behind the academics behind the people who work in these fields to make the right decisions
a series of economic projects united by a unique royal vision to name only these flagship projects firstly the port of tangier med symbol of the economic renewal of morocco this global industrial platform has become in just a few years the largest commercial port in africa with a capacity of processing of up to millions of containers millions of passengers seven hundred thousand trucks and export millions of vehicles in the renewable energy chapter on
complex nous ouarzazate was the first solar project developed as part of the Moroccan energy strategy which aims to increase the share of renewable energies in the national electricity mix to more than on the horizon this huge complex currently has four power plants launched between and extended over more than hectares  each power station uses different technologies  namely the parabolic mirror cylinder  the solar tower power station and the photovoltaic power station  the power in
stalled of the complex and megawatts in road logistics the national company of moroccan highways adm has since its creation invested a little more than billion dirhams for the realization of a highway network of km placing morocco in first position in the maghreb and in second position on the African continent  moreover  state investment in the road infrastructure sector should further consolidate annually billions of dirhams with an investment
nt of billions of dirhams we saw that year there on the railway plan the greatest achievement and the launch in November of the high-speed train at their arc according to the official figures of loncf between January and March no less than millions of customers chose the train to hal pulaar for their travel during the same period the number of customers increased by compared to the previous year and the trains showed close to regularity in terms of industry two sectors
t differentiated aeronautics and automotive actually the aeronautical sector has been able to attract in twenty years the largest engine and equipment manufacturers in the world such as safran thales or even bombardier with growth per year the one hundred and forty two companies established in the kingdom have generated billion dollars in turnover business and employees before the health crisis seventeen thousand five hundred people on the auto industry side and after the ping pong by the six years on a background of new south
  by then the automobile production capacity of morocco will increase to a minimum of one thousand vehicles per year two hundred thousand vehicles in the psa kénitra factory in the renault tangier factory and miles at the level of the somaca factory in casablanca finally and although agriculture remains the mainstay of Moroccan growth the green Morocco plan to accelerate the industrialization of the agricultural sector moreover on the twelve regional agricultural plans which have been declined billions of dirhams of private investments
 could be generated
despite the rise in the prices of raw materials and energy in morocco due to the russian ukrainian conflict and the effects of the covid pandemic and the rise of inflation which has severely affected the purchasing power of citizens the high commission in the plant is counting on growth after last year indeed there is optimism in the prospects for the moroccan economy why because whatever the world bank the international fomonte oacp the m
bank of Morocco or also the different law on economic growth between and for the year and this is based on several elements the essential element is will have fallen from phosphate there is also a fallout economic fallout from tourism there are also cars there is also agriculture because today we are talking about an average agricultural season vital sector of the Moroccan economy the primary sector would show  according to the estimates of the High Commission for Planning  an increase in
a level which remains largely dependent on a good progress of the agricultural campaign and an average cereal production while the experts expect the stability of the prices of fuel and abundant rains this season otherwise the agricultural crops would be affected this year by the same wave of drought which the kingdom witnessed last season the oil dam must remain between and dollars level per barrel and the second element must have rain
ie to have an agricultural season of millions of customers all this will of course impact the Moroccan economy but the dye is always impacted by inflation because we must there will always be a temptation or and also the unemployment rate it will always operate at the less on the firstthe first half of the face of these challenges experts call the Moroccan government continued to adopt good financial policies to support the weakened people and stimulate the
 investments in the country first of all the government must maintain the subsidy  in particular through the compensation fund  that is to say the subsidy for certain raw materials  gas and also cereals  therefore because these are basic necessities and this measure  I think  who will certainly participate in strengthening the purchasing power of Moroccans  especially the underprivileged classes  the poor  I also think that we must maintain the didier diesel subsidy at the driver
professional ctor and also I think that transport is a very important element for all industrial and economic activities in Morocco while waiting for an improvement in the international economy and the end of this inflationary shock had with the end of the war and the Ukrainian conflict in In this context  the High Commission for Planning affirms that the Kingdom will continue to support national economic and growth by increasing the budget allocated to public investments which has
will reach about billion dollars during the year
  good evening and welcome to the guest of the editorial staff of meditv this evening we are going to talk about the extraordinary transformation of morocco which is positioning itself today as an emerging country on the occasion of the th anniversary of the feast of the throne a conference was organized yesterday at the faculty of sciences the royal will to make morocco an emerging country such was the theme of this conference the opportunity to review the great achievements of morocco under
the leadership of king mohammed vi bridge between africa and europe morocco has launched several structuring projects during the last two decades  whether on the political  economic  social and health level  it is today an example to follow in terms of development and places itself as a leader in africa in several sectors such as industry  aeronautics  automotive  agriculture  tourism  renewable energies and it is from all these achievements that we will
talk this evening with our guest emmanuel dupuis good evening I remind you that you are president of the prospective and security institute in europe thank you for having accepted our invitation so morocco by its geographical position plays a somewhat central role it is the door to africa a bridge between africa and europe a credible partner today in whom we trust how morocco lives this centrality bah listen it was the subject of this conference that you to which you made you have
ez refers to a conference which brought together experts who brought together university academics of course Moroccan European academics Asian academics also the goal being to show that Morocco has a step-by-step policy and whose goal is obviously to understand the way in which it is perceived on both sides of the different continents with the perspectives or particularities specific to each continent I obviously speak as a French expert and don
c the way in which europeans must become aware of the strategic developments on the african content at the fire scene hassan ii the father of his majesty the king of medicine had this formula which i believe is particularly relevant and resonates with a particular topicality morocco such as a tree with enough roots  powerfully deeply rooted in africa  hence the need for african countries to understand the interest for them to have peaceful and prospective relations with the reign of ma
rock but it is also a tree whose tops which develops develops on both sides of the European and African continent with the only km which separate algeciras from tangier obviously showing that Morocco is part of a form of dynamics or cardinal diplomacy north-west west and obviously southern to show that in any case to demonstrate it was the subject of the debate in any case of the reflection that we have had in recent days here in Rabat of death to understand how and
  why Morocco must be heard and understood in its diplomatic transformation as it has already been engaged since accessionto the throne which therefore plays this role of union between Africa and the West then Morocco plays much more than that Morocco already plays a role of union between three continents to which it is linked by different realities geography with the European continent and in a certain way history returning at the Algeciras conference which sealed the partnership between the franc
e Spain and Morocco which by the Treaty of Fez became a protectorate which then the Treaty of Fez of which then has which are full independence in therefore there is also this historical relationship which must be taken into account and therefore sometimes the mutations or the understandings are sometimes poorly analyzed or poorly deciphered in relation to the postcolonial relationship whether with the Kingdom of Spain or the French Republic but also Morocco is part of a geography which makes it
one of them is a member of the African Union  moreover it is here in Morocco from Casablanca that the Pan-African idea was born and that from this given the exclusion or the racialization of Morocco from the African Union for years which was resolved and in a certain way resolved with the speech that pronounced the king on June January pardon of Abeba with the full and complete return of Morocco within an African shows that there is obviously there is an African return within his family moreover the king had prepared
delivered a rather moving speech in any case he was particularly moved for in his delivery and then obviously there is also the linguistic dimension the religious dimension which brings it another reality of a Morocco which accompanies or which also lives in a strategic horizontality on both sides of the Mediterranean from the part of its western part to its eastern part which brings it towards the Asian continent towards the Middle East we often associate the Mashreq e
t the the country the zone of the country of the rising sun the zone of the setting sun with this dynamic which means that Morocco also plays a very important role within the Arab League within the location of Islamic cooperation precisely by speaking of the dynamics of this position Morocco's strategic strategy which comes from its ultimately territorial anchoring makes it a key and major player so what impetus gives this new dynamic to the new relations which will be established today between the West
ent and Africa then the relationship between the West and Africa is not the only one which structures the externalities of the African continent moreover we can even say that the European continent or that the Western dimension alone is no longer the actor determining its African content it is one among many other actors moreover the United States sequences its continued African relationship differently than European countries do  the United States starting from the principle that it does not have a colonial substrate in
colonial st to have to assume even if they have other colonial logics in other parts of the world so there is perhaps a difference within Western countries with respect to the African continent the United States starts from the principle that the relationship that it wants to establish with the African continent and in particular with Morocco in particular is a win-win relationship  an economic and commercial relationship which also reminds us that the first American negation was here in Morocco in Tangier apart
ir from the end of the 18th century and then there is another dimension which means that the African continent has become the playing field in the literal sense of the term sometimes with a negative dimension of all the confrontations or all the strategic antagonists the Ukrainian war has here on the African continent a resonance with countries which do not have the same way of conceiving or positioning themselves visà-vis the Russian aggression carried out so on February of last year there are also emitter actors
ergents who here on the African continent want to bring Africa into an accompaniment of this emergence with the reappearance of the logic of non-alignment not having to choose neither Washington nor Moscow and to create a centrality and that is why the African content is become pivotal and Morocco has become central in this desire to position itself as a non-aligned power  that is to say a power which will have zero problems with all its neighbors in trying to have
a diplomacyin degrees as long as doing this little try to converge rather than diverge with its neighbors you are speaking yesterday since you were present during this conference it was during your speech you compared Morocco to China let's say that China had for a certain time taken advantage of so extraordinary way of the balance of power that there was between russia and the united states then you asked yourself this question what did france miss in its relations
ns with Morocco finally france like other European countries but france more than other European countries could have played this singularity which consists in making African content a continent in which the cold war is in a certain way put away in oblivion motorized this expression to know that the ideological struggle between east and west which lost the African continent with countries which had chosen liberalism is the case of Morocco of other countries this is the case of yours
being an Algerian neighbor who had chosen democratic centralism being closer to moscow and in a certain way should not have continued as a destructuring element of international relations leaving with the fall of the soviet union finally the dislocation of the soviet union the disappearance of the ussr had put away or put all all all the strategic elements that I mentioned flat gold force to note that a certain number of countries did not necessarily see the strategic changes
we are talking about European countries in particular in the support of relational and diplomatic diversification a certain number of countries take the case of Morocco had engaged between the countries said between times of the third world or said more prosaically developing countries or which pass from countries from the least developed to developing countries and therefore this support from Morocco and perhaps something on which other countries  in particular economic partners 
that pregnant france first economic partner of morocco until spain become the first partner of the kingdom of morocco could have should have and perhaps more developed absolutely so they would have finally missed this mutation which took place in morocco and took place quickly elsewhere on d and so could we say that the West should rather understand the aspirations of Morocco and Africa rather than questioning them?
support them and above all she should  if not understand them  accompany them she should take action and above all she should make sure to get out of the tropism of the dominator vis-à-vis the dominated or the dominant vis-à-vis the terrain or the territory to conquer the world has been the object of fracture of ideological fracture I mentioned them during the 20th century of civilizational fracture with the phenomenon of colonization from the th century onwards we entered another fracture which is this
the cause of a divide between countries that want to converge through win-win economic cooperation  let's call them since china often evokes them with logics that are not based too much on a strategic anachronism but rather with a prospective dimension that makes investments the choices of companies or the orientations in the economies of tomorrow in the digital in the health economy you mentioned them previously in the uberization of the economy fa
it that morocco more than others can lead to a hub or a centrality or a convergence an agglomeration of interests in one part in a much larger region which is that of the development of west africa just as the development of western europe has been a driving force a unifier that has made it possible to start from an economic unity of economic cooperation towards a European unity between the European coal and glacier community and therefore today with a political unity
e diplomatic who knows moreover reinforced in the light of the mobilization of the war in ukraine I believe that it is a little bit that the destiny of this region with the need to have dynamic countries driving countries like france and germany in europe in africa from the west and from this point of view there is one which is driving Morocco and then another which is a little more behind andn any case which is obviously not in a logic of sissiparity or strategic concomitance
your eastern neighbor is talking today about deoxidization of the world what is your opinion on that yes it is a reality but the deoxidization of the world goes hand in hand with changes of course strategies the logic which consisted in the north being able to help the south to develop in investing in so-called weaker more fragile economies to help development this is what is called official development assistance are totally to be revisited firstly because b
Many countries in the south have economies that are just as dynamic  not to say perhaps more dynamic than some countries say in the north  said to be western  the best proof of this is that if we compare the industries of the most industrialized losing countries  a member of the g  therefore  canada the united states japan great britain france germany and italy has been less than emerging or so-called emerged economies for about twenty years since  for example  organization of coo
operation of islamic cooperation cooperation shanghai pardon was created in june the copa its shanghai which brings together the countries of central asia plus now india pakistan iran and of course china and and russia obviously have a dimension a much more dynamism economic impact much more structuring financial as we speak here today in a few days at the end of July the brics summit to which countries and countries aspired will be held in johannesburg
t so finally maybe no more countries will integrate in this case probably not algeria but probably egypt probably indonesia probably the united arab emirates saudi arabia or even indonesia absolutely there were even requests so requests were taken into account and finally will be honored you also spoke yesterday when speaking of its precisely to make the Mediterranean a central mother and therefore to finally refocus the European project to reconfigure it to
what kind of reconfiguration do you already think we have to take a step back we are almost years away  but let's say years of euromillions cooperation which are an integral part of the European neighborhood policy but which testify to the duality or dichotomy that can exist between the countries of northern europe eastern and western europe so the one we are talking about the countries of the latin arc portugal spain italy greece with which we must associate
 of course malta now no longer cyprus and slovenia and croatia but let's say that the european project as it has existed since conceptualized economically with the european coal and steel community in april then economically and diplomatically with the treaty of rome in march it is a populous that is to say that the central axis was not the mediterranean it was rather central and eastern europe it is called politics the enlargement which took place with the dissociation of my soviet father
tick in the direction of the countries of central and eastern europe so i come back to my subject the treaty of lisbon as its name suggests was signed in a mediterranean country atlantico mediterranean in ratified voted in and ratified in so little little maybe sorry is it time to rethink a new treaty or in the absence of a new treaty to think about the relations that europe must have with the countries of the south this is therefore what was discussed with for the mediterranean which did not lead to
this great unifying civilizational project bringing together country entities plus financial institutions but whose goal was to create a basin logic  a logic which meant that the few million Mediterraneans also had common agendas to assert the protection of the environment the fight against inequality or injustice climate obviously with common unacceptables the question of the criminalization of migration the symmetry of the economy is obviously a me
common joint nace unfortunately resilient now for twenty years  in this case the question of terrorism  we are of course at the idea that while the union for the mediterranean is years old  it may be necessary to rethink the way in which the countries of the northern shore of the mediterraneanis the relationship with their southern neighbors and from this point of view there are undoubtedly new opportunities I think in particular that the creation wanted by France in any case wanted and defended by the president
mm macron of a European political community which now brings together European countries with an interest in associating neighboring countries and around Ukraine to enshrine  not to say prefigure  one of the desirable and upcoming ions of Ukraine as of the word of life and Georgia can integrate successful countries and in particular because they have relations through association agreements the association agreement between Morocco and the European Union is an old lady
it was signed in it was relaunched in and therefore perhaps it is a question of whether it is necessary to rethink our relationship just as the global gateway project initiated it by evoking the fact that if China has a Mediterranean design if Russia Iran and other countries intend to to position itself in the military in the West  Europe must not be left out and must have its own project  this is the reason why we must think both in a vertical geopolitics of Europe of the no
rd in South Africa literally in the south of the African continent with a transcontinental logic because economically we need to think of our partnership in a dual Euro-African way because Europe alone will be insufficiently armed or configured to fight against the large geo-economic blocs which are in the process of to establish itself in South Asia in Central Asia in Western Asia on one side in North America in Central America and in Latin America on the other therefore the necessity
to think about development jointly in an inclusive manner between European countries by expanding towards the countries of the European Union and in the same way by associating African countries in this new configuration how can Morocco position itself in relation to this global geopolitics which you are talking about it does not need to do anything else to demonstrate the place where it is located Morocco is at the same time a pivot between the Atlantic the Mediterranean West Africa the
sub-Saharan Africa it belongs to two economic integration zones even if one is a little weakened by the differences of assessments regarding its existence a union of the Maghreb but it belongs de factos and this is the reason why I believe she was right to ask join the economic and development community of West African countries to which it de facto belongs with these few km of coastline between the north and south of its territory and which it has
 leads to being a partner of stability with regard to its neighbors Mauritania but also in relation to the proximity of the conflictual ones of a country like Mali for example in talking about stability just now you are talking about terrorism so let's talk about this important role which is that of Morocco in the fight against terrorism but also in the stabilization of the Sahel region I believe that this is a role that France should have taken into account and should have anticipated France is like
 everyone understands that she is a slightly devalued actor in the way she tried to fight against arbitrator groups with countries that now no longer want her or in any case do not intend to see the same relationship as in the past on occasion so of the call that it was that of the Malian authorities from January to obviously fight against the metabolism groups and in the threat that constitutes the dislocation of the Malian state and de facto the dispersion in
the Sahel I also believe it is very important to have in mind that the stabilization of salt can only be done if the neighboring countries that a regional approach are associated the same goes with Libya Libya can only be stabilized if there is this application of direct neighbors or as Morocco had initiated it from we call it the discussions of bouznika bouznika and bouznika with the notion of regionalizing of Africanizing of having a diplomacy of proximity and of course
taking into account the fact that the question of the fight against armed terrorist groups is not only a security question it is a question which is obviously autant societal than security let's take the example of what Morocco has to offer and on which perhaps countries like France could rely or on which they should converge the mohamed vi institute which trains imams throughout the West African region therefore spiritual diplomacy or introspection spiritual
brings to the chedelia of fez from the years from the th century which means that a Sufi Islam irradiated and was able to constitute an oath affirming relational follow-up on which to support the development of a stronger cooperation between Morocco and its neighbors to the south-east of its southeast in this case Mauritania Mali and by extension Niger I see another element and that was discussed during this summit to try to ensure that if countries like France or countries called Western
x the european union in particular cannot or can no longer convince the local authorities to help them in their joint fight against armed terrorist groups perhaps it is necessary to delegate to countries which have the same interests and this is where morocco comes into play perhaps have third-country investment logics  that is to say that we should use the very strong capacity where still respectful or interested listening on the part of these countries towards Morocco and perhaps
to be delegated to the forceur but Moroccan the idea of ​​​​training the Malian armed forces since it is necessarily said to be Malian or Burkinabè or in view of the coup d'etat of and no longer want to do it with France and it is on this last word that our interview therefore ends this theme in truth needed a lot more time so it was a pleasure to have you with him I remind you that you are president of the prospective institute of security in europe thank you so that's the end of this
your interview thank you for your loyalty stay with us see you tomorrow for a new theme applause
located between the mediterranean basin and the atlantic ocean morocco is the fifth economic power of africa to help you prepare your competitions we went to casablanca often considered as the economic capital of morocco in order to better understand the situation of the country to begin our journey we go to the campus of a french school located in morocco toulouse business hen we meet there david station and professors and entrepreneurs he gives us the
he first keys in order to understand the economy of the country and Morocco it has been almost twenty years since he has followed a crossover of the economy almost and stable between and pv it gives you an idea of ​​the stability and in Morocco lately and it gives confidence to the investor has gone dark business to settle in a country like morocco and serves as the gateway to the remnants of milk continues morocco today is the countries between the top three countries of africa destination for investment
ment abroad in addition to attracting investors morocco acts as an economic power of africa it ranks fifth in terms of nominal gross domestic product from a sectoral point of view morocco relies mainly on a service economy nevertheless a good part of the population remains employed in agriculture and mining but the country has a number of strengths the best time is the situation is strategic and political
that he sealed pau between europe and africa it is the door to africa for all legal investments and secondly it is political instability the kings he gave a reliable and solid long-term axis after there are all the reforms what is the moroccan government he followed that done years we continue our discussions with mohamed rherrabi he is director of the toulouse business school campus in casablanca and according to him it is towards africa that morocco now has every interest in turning to
 Morocco has chosen to integrate into its continent  that is to say for a long time between our economy was oriented towards Europe  these are the political choices we have made lately Morocco has decided to open up on its continent and therefore to embark on investment opportunities in some sub-Saharan countries and we have chosen this of the sectors the banking sector the telecom sector thee rice sector and the furniture states and the mining sector in e
indeed even if africa only represented exports from morocco far behind europe it is a geographical area that offers more and more appeal to moroccan companies the wind is in the process of finding a place in production and in the ranking  i would say emerging markets with strong potential and industrial growth to realize the economic reality of morocco we continue our walk in the streets of casablanca towards the quarter
er of sidi maârouf for a visit of the places reserved for casablancese companies the technoparc opened in it accompanies more moroccan companies by offering them in particular a whole range of services we meet tarik mounim responsible for a coworking space dedicated to young moroccan entrepreneurs so this is the first free coworking space dedicated to startup project holders to be able to work develop and as its name indicates on start up start your projects
so today we have two startups that went there that they then settled in the technoparc we have master classes we also have ring coat support programs and we have the youngest Moroccan startup which is moreover perhaps African to conclude our overview of the economy moroccan we take the car and we go to the east of casablanca this is where a car factory is located somaca the renault group and produces more vehicles from the dacia range each year than
soma that people are employed to run the machine for hours on it must be said that Morocco is an important market for renault the sector at the time when there is a shortage represents a very important stake for Morocco economic is the first exporting sector in Morocco we have exceeded that is two years in its third year the phosphate sector of what we manufacture goes to export at the level of its mac while there is a very important issue to meet the requirements of markets and customers
and therefore what is called the mail is dead to the body  that is to say the quality of cars manufactured in Morocco must be irreproachable it is an important issue for us if europe remains the main export market for renault vehicles produced in casablanca the french automobile company is not unaware the prospects of the African continent are funny  but the door to Africa for Europe is an important issue in terms of geography and therefore all of this means that the lack of a certain number of
all it is very open to its external environment and therefore all this means that the lack of success in attracting investment for renault as for many companies in morocco the future challenges are therefore threefold responding to the growth of the moroccan market continues to satisfy european demand and turn to a continent with very high potential  Africa
  at the end of the years of the last century launching a great program of reform aimed at bringing china to much more flourishing horizons than it was it was a so-called poverty-stricken country living off agriculture and it tried a number of reforms which put in before the economy economic openness and the call for foreign investment the rest we know multiplication by and more of chinese gdp today china is the second economic power in the world
 with a gdp approaching billions of dollars other countries have followed the same path before or after south korea vietnam is it perhaps time to ask the question what has made the success of these countries and why not despite everything ask the question is it possible to draw inspiration from this success to see how to bring our economy and our society and our country to two much more ambitious horizons  first of all there is the political will and the mobilization of citizens the political will
eu and the muse of citizen use to achieve much higher development goals us our current positioning is much easier if you allow me the expression than what was in china korea vietnam at the time it is much easier because we we have a few strengths that I would like to remind you of we are a diversified economy that is to say it is a flu economyx which lives by the production of goods which is renewed it does not
does not rely on mining products subsoil products it does not have what other economists call the energy curse or the curse of raw materials they are based on these riches produced themselves and which are renewed we have for several years more nevertheless acquired experience in the primary sector through the partial modernization of our agriculture we now have serious experience in the industry through the installation of
e the automotive ecosystem and the aeronautical ecosystem through some breakthroughs in other sectors and we also have real and substantial progress in the field of services in several sectors of activity  is it not time to ask ourselves the question of making sure to call for mobilization to be able to go move forward and take new levels of growth Morocco is currently located in terms of income per capita on the countries to return low intermediate i.e.
ire lower than dollars the objective is to bring this level towards dollars on the horizon why state these figures sometimes I am criticized for saying well these are figures which are there to try to reduce government activity far don't care these figures allow us to situate our expectations the expectations of the citizens and neither real possibilities of this country and I think we can say that on the horizon we can if we work properly if we mobilize our multi
iples our energies reached dollars per capita  that is to say on the horizon with a population of millions of inhabitants reaching the figure of billions of dollars of GDP is enormous for some but why not set this objective when he launched his reform process called for doubling even to triple the Chinese GDP and he did not hesitate in front of his figures it takes optimism of will and we also now have an important asset beyond the diversity of our economy
omie j insists on the diversity of our economy because it is a condition of emergence emergence cannot take place in economies which are based on raw materials extracted from the earth or wealth extracted from the earth there is a need for diversification and economics to move towards emergence so there is no place to make comparisons we are in a good position to be able to move forward I said that we now have a very important oxy atom it is that of the
 necessary energy transition and atops to be able to ensure our energy autonomy or even export green energy in the future these are very real things which are there and which can  thanks to appropriate governance with through mobilization  move towards much more prosperous and prosperous futures. much more promising futures it is necessary only a question of governance no we can also recall that Morocco has human resources which are enc
ore partially used I recalled the other day that the activity rate was of the order of according to the figures from the high planning commission it is very low we have enormous potential to further bring to fruition work we also have capital to mobilize we have the possibility of bringing in new investments I also always have in perspective and here I am talking about a certain number of contributions which have been made in recent months these recent weeks which
have the objective of insisting around our proposals there is a vision this vision that of taking Morocco towards horizons of emerging economy proposals to reinforce the giant steps which are being accomplished in Morocco in the acquisition of the status of regional power I I think that these are important elements beyond all that  an economy that is running  an economy that is working  we must necessarily be able to pay attention to the energy aspect.
rtes but we also wanted knowledge economy we must again and again and we must seriously look into the training of our citizens on the education of our citizens we still have significant deficits unfortunately there is a general feeling which is moving towards a certain defiance screweven with regard to education and it is quite sad for a country like ours  we must be able to release a new mobilization of new energies to achieve our
our objective our objective of billions I repeat it of dollars on the horizon our neighbors to mention again that these are not our model or one without fail sets an objective of billions they have a larger population but it would be very surprising author that he can reach it for a very simple reason that it is only based on the price of the barrel the price of the barrel cannot reach with their production its horizons and these figures so if we manage to go towards these milli
ards as an objective of stages for we can say that we are going to make a breakthrough or a decisive difference vis-à-vis our neighborhood which is important but beyond our neighborhood it is not only Algeria there is Spain which is also an intermediate economy and which is going towards competition with the moroccan economy there are morocco's ambitions in africa and there is also the need for us to strengthen a relationship with europe our presence in africa and in other
s countries as you can see we are of course proposing built on a vision of realistic achievable ambitions which require mobilization good governance and great ambitions for the for this country great ambitions which are of course the ambitions of each and every one of us
  the year promises to be economically difficult for the three major global economic groups the united states of america china and europe europe and china are already experiencing a recession that is to say a succession of declines in gdp twist two quarters growth in the united states is not very significant which means that there is probably a risk of seeing global economic growth at half mast this of course will impact the situation of morocco open economy since it has so many relations
maintained with its European partner the assumptions made by the finance law of an inflation of and a growth rate of seems compromised first of all inflation on the assembly it goes without saying insofar as having had a relatively high inflation rate higher enough sneezed previous it was difficult to claim to reduce inflation this year  especially since the international situation is still characterized by a conflict in ukraine and strategic circumstances
compromised insofar as many inflationary elements are there  in particular the high price of hydrocarbons the probably high price of cereals also due to the fact that there are transport and delivery problems and the continuation of conflict wheat in Ukraine which has of course introduced all this upheaval in the global economic air we are undergoing as a country is this situation what the fact of experiencing a difficult global situation would justify on our part to certain
Ins immobility Let's say that we are suffering from imported inflation Our relations with our partners without slowing down insofar as they too are experiencing a recession in their economy Is this the right attitude to take or is it not? It is a way for us too to challenge our mode of growth our our economy and can we not call on our deep resources to be able to generate resilience for this Morocco which has a great desire to play an important role?
bringing to his region a few days ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs or what acts as Minister for Foreign Affairs of the European Union visited Morocco it was a visit which was postponed several times and following this visit he made a statement which can be summarized as follows Europe will in the coming years and it is foreseeable to experience a downturn in its investments since it will be mainly interested in the
european space there will be a significant relocation movement and most of the investments will be intended for europe or the european space also has problems with immigration and of the world to its partners in a firm way that it was migration to be stopped if it is not controlled the role also asks its European partners to be vigilant as to the attitude they have towards theAfrica with regard to their development and also asks that they take into consideration
an element which is major in my opinion that of the change in the attitude of the European Union not in the field of immigration in the economic field and in the same area of ​​investments but what we could call the new European development model based on the carbon economy they have already taken the decision by the European Parliament to no longer produce fossil or thermal energy cars from and they have the desire to arrive at a carbon model to
 this decision required an immense investment effort on their part since it involves starting next year to make investments of the order of billions of euros  that is to say practically the equivalent of three times Morocco's GDP each year to be able to achieve this end. or for this purpose it is an important element and which is challenged by our equipment a reflection on the future of Europe if you had this Europe which wishes to isolate itself it is a Europe which refuses
e immigration if it is a dress that is afraid because there is also the Ukrainian trauma this Europe how are we going to be the partners of this Europe because it is our main partner are we going to look for other opportunities to trade other opportunities for development or having to have the intelligence not to not back down from this challenge that Europe poses to us because ultimately it is a challenge that Europe poses to us to know if you do not move towards clean production we
we invite you to see elsewhere have elsewhere with your cars in the coming years to the extent that the Tangier and Kenitra factory produces in their vast majority thermal energy cars you must see elsewhere also in your in your industrial products in your pros in your in your exports and so but I understood the significance of the recent meeting held by His Majesty the King on the need to open the large project of already renewable green hydrogen from man
In general  it is a major project and it is an immense opportunity for our country  I say immense  to the extent that it could allow us to achieve a certain number of ambitions which are ours to become a friendly emerging economy and a regional power such as I I always wanted to make my wishes with others because if we truly commit ourselves to this perspective we risk in a few years we risk or we will have the cha
nce to become a country producing excess energy it would be magnificent and producer of energy reborn any energy of clean energy and this energy could allow us not to have an exchange with Europe of mistrust and proposals for energy which is not in fact polluting but to go much further quickly as the whole of Europe in achieving clean production a few days ago the Minister of Energy said that the production potential of our clean energy
 and of the order of gigawatts to give you an idea the capacity to install today in Morocco all sets of production combined it is of the order gw with an electrical production unfortunately this is no longer tolerable we must move quickly and firmly towards the production of energy clean  Morocco must seize this immense historical opportunity in a way how can we qualify this so-called unique opportunity to become an energy producer for itself
and even to export energy  of course it is not for tomorrow but it can be done in the coming years and I hope that the royal vision will find lasting power within the government and I also hope that this government will be able to tackle this issue head on which has my sense of the files which offers a major opportunity for our country to move from entirely green  entirely electric production it is not a dream France in France electric production and the challenges
carbon and the fact of nuclear energy we can do it with green energy it is not something unachievable completely feasible it requires investments and indeed there is reason to seek investments and to seek out people interested in thisproduction so it is a year that offers this great energy opportunity which is following this attitude of confinement of europe and which gives us the opportunity to think about a new model of growth
ssance like them think about a new model of growth and addelity forward and instead of moving away from arabic we are going through this clean production of clean energy to get closer to europe because we will be more competitive than many european countries here are the problems that turn into politics a crisis that opens up new perspectives and the new perspectives are good also insofar as this year is not just a
year which will certainly experience economic difficulties which against will certainly also experience climatic disturbances with the problem of rainfall with the problem of water to which we must also give the required importance but also will probably allow Morocco to do again and again and that is not To displease us with the major diplomatic advances in the national question  Morocco has opportunities Morocco can move forward and seize these opportunities to
 to project ourselves into a situation where it begins sabordination and there we come to the last point which seems important to us to underline the economic difficulties inflation the international constraints the increase in the cost of products the harsh climatic conditions must in no way dissuade the government from stopping the reform process we are going through this reform process whether it is reforms that affect investment labor law social protection
 education  health  regionalization and others these are reforms that will allow us to build the modern Morocco to which we aspire a modern Morocco where the state plays a role of a social state of a protective state a modern Morocco that no longer has to worry about energy and imports energy producer of clean energy in modern morocco which is part of industrialization and modernization this is a this is a chronicle of an optimism which believes that the optimist is combined with the
both by a will but also by a certain rationality I wish you once again a very happy new year
  with its two landlocked maritime facades its fisheries and energy resources morocco enjoys significant maritime capital as such it benefits from the long history of maritime activities which generate a considerable share in terms of gdp and employment however coastal areas experience high environmental pressure from fact of the growing littoralization this situation is aggravated by climate change and the increase in anthropic activities which threaten
between the oceans but then how Morocco could take advantage of the potential of its maritime space it would be necessary to commit to an efficient blue economy  that is to say a sustainable management of marine ecosystems and the resources associated with them the blue economy presents a new opportunity for the Morocco as it aims to promote economic growth  social inclusion and the conservation or improvement of livelihoods while ensuring the sustainability of the environment.
on the oceans and coastal areas  which places it at the heart of the country's new development model this summer  the csa recommends setting up a more sustainable and inclusive national economic strategy adapted to regional vocations is deployed around economic sectors traditional while developing new sectors with strong growth potential the board also offers two priorities research innovation and training analyze all risks
 that arises around the sea and coastal professions ensuring the ecological transition necessary to reduce the impact of pollution and overexploitation
moroccan economic destruction with you vicky bogaert so since and the coming to power of mohamed how the country has evolved and well over the years morocco is still industrialized has modernized king mohamed has launched a policy of major construction sites construction of motorway bridges in industrial areas the tgv tanger casablanca was inaugurated last year and in juneit is the ultramodern tanger med port which opened two new terminals it is the culmination of a pharaonic project
ue is the port has been able to stand out from the competition in a significant way in the Mediterranean basin today we can declare we have become the first container platform in the Mediterranean Morocco has therefore become a country which attracts foreign investors it is also a very active in Africa  the country has increased investments in Senegal  Ivory Coast and Egypt and the monarchy is directly involved in the economic life of the country.
family investment in participations via an investment fund in the main sectors of activity but this development of the area is not enough to overcome inequalities poverty well no we hold it Morocco and even the most unequal country in North Africa the wealth is mainly concentrated in city centers to the detriment often of the countryside some figures to illustrate the situation of young people more than years old are unemployed two million young Moroccans
are neither students nor employees nor on internship many jobs remain informal is also false of future and well this young person in ten plans to emigrate according to a recent survey another problem he says corruption completely according to the IMF it costs the country more than billions of dirhams per year about billion euros result of the extent of these inequalities the country is only in th place on approximately Monday of human development of the UN it is not far from Algeria of Tunisia but it remains when
 even behind and at the level of wages where we are we want it then the minimum wage has just been increased but it remains very low dirhams per hour for the liberal professions and the sectors of commerce and industry it corresponds approximately to euro of their for agriculture it is even lower the working day is set at minimum trains are a little more euros per day list your guards thank you see you soon thank you
the annual inflation rate in Morocco jumped to in January against in December the planning commission the official body in charge of statistics declared in a press release made public on Wednesday that the increase in inflation is due to the increase in the prices of food products of monsieur will notice that they are still high and people no longer have the means to buy dirhams around euros was enough to buy vegetables for a week now even dirhams around euros
 are not enough this corresponds to almost more than the purchasing power of citizens today we cannot buy food products with the money we have because of the rise in prices we must first lower the prices of basic necessities flour sugar and oil because these are products that people use a lot Morocco was negatively impacted by the Russo-Ukrainian war just like the rest of the world economies with an increase in prices
 raw materials  food and energy the world bank has revised downwards its economic growth forecasts for Morocco but it still expects growth thanks to the revival of the agricultural sector
thanks to phosphate we manufacture what we call fertilizers and it is one and fertilizers this vital for world food security we have noticed that top point Algeria is in the process of conceding a masterful and terrifying defeat against Morocco if Algeria in Morocco they have ocb which is the phosphate surgeon office which is a public company thanks to this situation that Morocco has been able to afford a significant turnover at the level of almost billions of euros Morocco has announced
the sending of the he recalled a cargo of tons which would give to the office the office is a country of Latin America why because the office had reestablished its relations or the saône with the Algerian chicken of tamponne bravo let's direct the new Algeria you offered a royal boulevard to the Moroccan competitor who has imposed himself royally on the world industrial scene since the start of the war in Ukraine and the global crisis  both geopolitical  economic and financial.
 talks about rising gas prices the importance of natural gasu oil and hydrocarbons in general and that the role how adoles are instrumentalized or used as a weapon of war whether by russia or the western adversaries part in particular the united states of america and how the global energy crisis is changing the face of the world by allowing the emergence of new new powers or there to redraw the world order there is another
important wealth which is in the process of which we talk very little we talk very little but which has a key role in this crisis and which is proving to be a very important wealth of strategies it is about phosphates phosphates have all have become it's a it's a wealth it's a wealth of the subsoil or the it's a natural wealth which has become as important as oil and gas because thanks to phosphate we manufacture what we call fertilizers and it's a
ne and fertilizers are vital for global food security because without fertilizers we cannot have we cannot increase the productivity of farms where we cannot rather increase the productivity of agricultural exports and we cannot strengthen the agricultural production of all countries in the world it is not possible to grow crops all over the world without fertilizers are fertilizers and without fertilizers we cannot have agriculture and we cannot produce much
up of vegetable and fruit food products and the others we cannot meet the demand for the idea of ​​their food needs of a humanity which which has a population growth which is significant and everyone all the studies all the expertise all the notes of brilliant and insightful conjuncture will play a determining role also held a it has become a wealth where the a source of energy as important as gas and oil unfortunately the phosphates we
we have noticed that algeria from togo is in the process of conceding a masterful and terrifying defeat against morocco algeria which had the possibility of positioning itself since well before the crisis which was born in the aftermath of the war no it is not success in ukraine we would have been able to position itself well before the key as one of the most important producers and exporters of phosphate thanks to a project which was which was which was to start at the time of bouteflika in and which was its beauty because of iraq and
t of and the campaign for the fifth term and the political crisis that has shaken the country since or madam all the project was then reconfigured and even today the famous project I am talking about the famous phosphate project could not see the light of day it is never likely to see the light of day during this time in Morocco and I add to myself Morocco has become the world's second largest producer of phosphate after China it has world reserves of phosphate this is Algeria at sona
tarac in morocco they have ocp which is the phosphate surgeon office which is another public takeover which holds the monopoly in the exploitation of practically all the phosphate mines and hold on tight to the turnover is at ocp is was recorded a rise of who to know it exceeded billion and a half euros almost billion euros and the increase in fertilizer prices on the street it is the world's largest exporter and because of the global sanctions to and
Western countries rather apply to russia and the availability of tabs on the world market has been totally disrupted and Morocco has been cleverly taking advantage of this situation to increase its exploitations of tabs and in particular to increase its exports of the raw material which are the phosphate minerals to manufacture its fertilizers it is thanks to this situation that Morocco still uses Morocco and has benefited from this crisis it still uses phosphate
te in its diplomatic and political war to establish its dominance over the salary recently for example morocco canceled the shipment to recall it a cargo of tons which therefore which was intended for the office the office is a latin american country why because the office had restored his relations or the saône with the for the teenagers the front for the lambs who recommends who asks remember well you know it well independent of the syndromeWestern so Morocco made use of it
the weapons of its main economic soul in a very pragmatic way which are phosphates and which are fertilizers and the office has been punished and Morocco is putting pressure on it does not even want to sell it preparation not to sell or not give the phosphates or there the fertilizers you are going to fertilize the essential raw materials for manufacturing to all these countries where there to all the countries which do not recognize its sovereignty over the western living room so Morocco is in
making ajma use of its main economic weapon which is phosphates today morocco represents of the world market of phosphates as one benefits amply from this crisis of the english from this crisis which is from the charity of the excessive increase in the price of fertilizers from the beginning of the war of the skull and the application of western samsung against russia which I remind you once again was the world's largest exporter so I'm not doing a good shit unfortunately
 in algeria we had a very good opportunity to become perhaps not dethrone morocco because morocco important production which cost me the account no we were producing towards million tons and algeria wanted to go up to million tons and we have the reserves to produce and export up to millions of tons per year and to compete a little with morocco perhaps not dethrone its place but in any case we could have competed with locp and morocco with the famous pr
phosphate maker object the most paid desk the phosphate maker project integrate our business on which algeria share investigate he had revealed something he made a revelation mold it is a project unfortunately since we could have built a mega industrial project I say mega industrial project in algeria thanks to the extraction then thanks to a share with the chinese which could have allowed an algeria to export between up to practically million tons the objectivity of reaching
 an export level of millions of tons of phosphate to earn up to billions of dollars per year the project what was the famous industrial project which was to allow the extraction of millions of tons of high quality phosphate and then blade then with this phosphate which will be extracted from plus that we could have produced millions of tons of phosphoric acid then we had to create a support unit for the recovery of the discharges of the discharges await re
fluorinated jets from korea assistance protection units which will make it possible to proscribe and allow the production of tons of hydrofluoric acid this is another acid that comes from phosphate which was supposed once again for the manufacture of fertilizers tons of silicon dioxide we turns in all we could have had a million in Algeria would have been able with the project date of that to produce tons of ammonia and millions of tents to bawl which is considerable and the
export of these of this ammonia and its nails thanks to the millions of tons of phosphates that we could have extracted of high quality there the mines of the bled bah we could really have created up to jobs and carried out exports of billions of billions of dollars so far in a start and go up to billions of dollars which allows us before the crisis in ukraine before the crisis which began on the sidelines of the war of the invasion of ukraine during russia these figures there it is
We should go double see them dribble since the nails have become rare and the phosphates have become very sought after and very popular on the world market so we could have made a lot more money it would have just been necessary to concretize the project which was to start which was signed in between and negotiated between and with a large ugly chinese group in the setif china international investment corporation which is china's largest state conglomerate the choir is
 signed remember in November and the project was to officially start jet the new football algeria they sabotaged this project that it will be the project behind then algeria leaves so as not to dwell on all the revelations that have been made by algeria on this project there how we are going to postpone March the Algerian regime the fathis is what algeria said at the time the algerian regime made it the exploitation of the country's phosphate deposit cda of chinese companies of small ta
illes there are occult interests we delayed we blocked this project which was to see the light of day definitively we blocked for more than years the largest Chinese state conglomerate to give it to two small companies of Chinese society which do not have the ability to have the billions of dollars needed to launch the industrial exploitation of phosphate deposits to build all the industrial units that were planned for this skikda or part of it on ar
ras and units from and to or or what we call it to the industrial platform for the export of fertilizers and ammonia from the port of annaba project x that this just because our corruption ledgemate did not want to give chips here is a small chinese company it there is an internet company everything is on algeria sorry we have spoken in several programs we have spoken about it in several articles the consequence here it is today morocco geopolitical adversary of
in algeria we are benefiting greatly he is going he is going to win he is in the process he is going to end the year with almost billions of euros in phosphates and fertilizers he has become an influential country on the political scene because he uses phosphates and fertilizers to oblige countries that need these important raw materials for food security to align with its political positions of which it is sand and Algeria is stupidly deprived of a political weapon of an economic weapon of income
 in currency and a project which could have created at least jobs and which could have opened up significant industrial prospects for future generations the ppi de sable project the exploitation of the volkswagen bensaite mines project is considered to be the most industrial project most important of the african continent lease was its beauty bravo the algeria of you good bravo the new algeria of top good bravo leading the new algeria you offered a royal boulevard to a
a Moroccan competitor who has imposed himself royally on the world industrial scene by continuing to dominate the world phosphate market
we managed to choose casablanca in morocco to prepare all these fishing vessels a market of several hundred million euros will go directly to benefit morocco and that he will not profit these are the risks that invest in morocco with the money we give them with the trees we bought them the trees they didn't see anything this money we give them back to Morocco and the interests the economic interests are more important in Morocco in Algeria Russian tourists are a lot
 more numerous in Morocco than in Algeria and that this support is said to be Russian for the Algerian regime than in and beginning that using the Algerian regime to scare its opponents its opponents its competitors that we believe we are protected by vladimir poutine military power rue will be on our side and we will use military power to defend ourselves that poutine will do for algeria what he did for the series of bashar elassad and that he will intervene and do all that these
t cat pee the proof we have always been made to believe in any case in the Algerian-Moroccan conflict that Russia on the side of Algeria will always be on the side of Algeria which will even protect from Algeria or to help Algeria to protect itself is by unfortunately a war breaks out with Morocco and Morocco is supported by the United States of America Israel and that the West would come to India in Morocco against Algeria we have always been made to believe and well it is the opposite the lesson is the problem
Algerian Moroccan it is not it is not aligned with the Algerian position against Morocco and does not favor Morocco and we do not rather favor Algeria to the detriment of Morocco and it supplies a lot of weapons to Algeria it is with Morocco it does business and business the most interesting and the most prosperous it is made with the world's proof Russia has chosen Casablanca in Morocco to prepare all these fishing vessels a market of several hundred million euros
will go and benefit directly in Morocco and that will not benefit in Algeria and theseIt's not me who says it  it's the head of the office of the Russian Federal Fisheries Agency called Mira except who announced last Thursday that Russian fishing vessels will be repaired in the port of the Moroccan city of Casablanca instead of the port of Las Palmas pleasure which belong to Spain because of the European sanctions here against Russia Europeans European countries no longer have the right to deal with
 doing business with Russia  particularly everything that concerns the repair of fishing boats and which requires a certain know-how and that Russia has very large fishing fleets off international coasts as we cannot repatriate them until success for them to repair them then send them back to their fishing mission she had a contract with las palmas with the others with the Spanish with the Spanish operators and the Spanish state
so that the hundreds I am talking about hundreds of Russian fishing vessels can be repaired and renovated and undergo overhaul work in the port of Las Palmas  Brazil  Canary Islands  or this year as it is the war in Ukraine and European sanctions impose a ban to the Spanish and to the Spanish operators to the Spanish authorities to work and to have relationships and friends cooperation of economic affairs with Russia by Lucia decided ok then we can so
n contract with the Spanish therefore the repairs of a group of Russian fishing vessels which operates in the central eastern Atlantic will simply be entrusted to Moroccan companies and not Algerian Morocco ally which are in our protector which supposedly provides us with weapons yes they don't give trees we buy the trees we pay for them the weapons were not given to us for free I have never seen never heard of a donation from Russia concerning Algeria concerning
the weapons but of course the business done with who with the Moroccans it is I repeat I quote it so the I am always on the Russian official Mireille Tarazov who is the president of the federal agency the head of the representative office of the federal agency happy to fishing rose garden blood sorry I don't know the chandelier a language a little complicated for me rosie blotto good whatever it's the Russian federal fisheries agency the federal agency dispatch this is what it says precisely n
We are talking about hundreds of millions of euros of hundreds of millions of euros which will be paid to the loco shipyard in Morocco as well as hundreds of jobs for Moroccans we hope to open a new shipyard in Casablanca in Morocco these are the risks that invest in Morocco with the money that we give them with the weapons we bought them the weapons they saw nothing of this money we give them back to the Moroccan to make direct economic investments well done the leaders
giants bravo you are very intelligent what he is doing then we are talking about a ship repair facility in casablanca which can fully compete with the canary shipyards so russia wants to invest in morocco to develop shipyards to compete with the shipyards of spain on the islands Canaries and the Russians are delighted with this economic cooperation with Morocco and of course I would like the Algerian leaders to tell me what is the rus
sie has invested economically in our country but apart from exporting weapons and some machines and some industrial equipment the economic presence in Algeria it Russian economic in Algeria it is almost non-existent are interesting to walk Algerian but it has never given rise to big projects or the disinvestments important for the success Algeria is not an activist client of a loyal client for the weapons no more there is no particular attachment the r
usses have no particular attachment have no particular interest with Algeria except for the order of weapons billions of times billions of times we buy back a lot of weapons from our our armament therefore and from our elected armament it is indeed there is a great military collaboration with Russia but this collaboration brings absolutely no added value to Algeria which does not benefit at all from the power of leverage in ourarea to earn diverse
ier its economy or win it from other interests there either we strengthen it with its partnerships nothing Morocco does not buy Russian weapons but it does a lot of business with Russia it is one of the main partners in the success of the African continent  particularly in the cooperation of the fishing in November Morocco succeeded they signed a year-long agreement for cooperation in magnetic fishing which replaced a previous agreement which expired in March in Algeria
Erie was practically at war with Morocco Russia did not hesitate to renew its contract with Morocco and invest once again in Morocco and it displays itself with Morocco without any hesitation while Algeria is faithful allies are faithful allou Algeria its client is broken to piggy bank because it is Algeria which provides billions of dollars to Russia for the purchase of weapons has absolutely benefited therefore an intention and therefore a friendly gesture from Russia I remind you again u
only once during the Security Council resolution concerning Western Sahara which was adopted on October and the council of success as a permanent member of the Security Council did not vote against this resolution did not vote for and it abstained it in no way condemned the Moroccan occupation of as the Algerian regime demands each time as the food regime creates each time it does not clearly support us the option of independence of its Western as
 wants it or there as required by Algerian diplomacy and as wishes or there we dream of Algeria so what have we gained with Russia in what way does Mr. Putin's Russia help us to privilege us or he gives us some priority while we do not buy much of trees university many billions we provoked the austerity of the austerity of the West we entered into a standoff with France and the United States of America because of that we are subject to a lot of American pressure and
threats from the Americans there the leaders have calmed down since the beginning of the summer because they have clearly seen that the Allied street in Ukraine is getting bogged down we have trained militarily with Russia we have done three military exercises the exercise was planned of the first of November where it is very planned on the first of November the Algerian generals no longer speak of it and apparently I believe that it has not been maintained we will try to verify there was a joint military exercise between
e the Russian soldiers the Algerian soldiers in the wilaya in a locality located not very far from the Moroccan borders moreover and Algeria had agreed to negotiate this military exercise for his mother to show her muscles and tell the Moroccan men you have the Israelis we are we have next to china next to us on our side the chandeliers except that my coco lelus so my invests in morocco much more than in algeria they have equally good relations with
Morocco with Algeria they even have better relations with Morocco with Algeria because what is one of the good relations is not the gesture no between states and interests economic interests are more important in Morocco in Algeria Russian tourists are much more many in Morocco than in Algeria where is the internet the specificity of meditation we would like to have we would like to have we need weapons we have trained and secondly that is Algeria has p
participated in two important military exercises in with a taste of Russia she took the risk of appearing alongside Russia practically joined the Russian clan and we won what walou zero we gained nothing because the Algerian leaders this are the world champions of the unification of waste and incompetence and they do not take they spend their time adopting positions favorable to foreign countries are that Algeria is that our country does not win
s one iota an interest the united states and the west
in Switzerland and I die they have an economic device to encourage economic cooperation with emerging countries device allows to financially help foreign exporting companies and importing companies Vietnam Bosnia Albania Morocco the worst or South Africa in allcase these are countries that are considered that with which switzerland is dealing at the moment switzerland helps moroccan and tunisian companies that want to export to switzerland
the algerian who wanted to support switzerland no help because algeria is excluded from this point is not considered as a priority country switzerland in considers tunisia morocco as countries much more priority than algeria in its relations which algeria switzerland enters with a little with the Algerian pressure we could have flexed when the Swiss have nothing to do but frankly nothing to the Algerian leaders in recent years  especially since
  today there is a country in europe which is much smaller than algeria which is much less populated than algeria and it is a country which is considering algeria when the greater algeria which does not even give it importance but i will not tell you salina he does not even consider us as a priority country in these economic exchanges this country is switzerland the little switzerland ajma is million and a half inhabitants the annual wealth and of switzerland is more than billions of
The millions and a few dollars of Switzerland produce each year in any case billions of dollars while millions of Algeria of millions of Algerians have produced billions of dollars  that is to say that Switzerland is sometimes richer than Algeria  so it is three times less populated practically or four times less populated the more it is four times less populated than algeria it is not times practically times less populated than algeria but the times richer than algeria then
 economic device to encourage economic cooperation with emerging countries the economic program for the promotion of foreign trade the underlay of being switzerland and the girl a program that allows swiss importers to import material goods from certain emerging countries but we help them to import with the countries that switzerland considers are interesting or would deserve to be helped to support their economic development and switzerland is so r
iche she wants to help other countries that are still poor we are in Swiss companies to import money to trade with companies from countries that are not yet rich who are poor who are paid who want to become emerging countries device allows to helping foreign exporting companies and importing companies financially is a very interesting device which therefore allows the countries which are economic partners with Switzerland to be the
to have win-win relationships switzerland is a country that exports a lot but it needs to import and the countries that want to export it to switzerland that they want to develop economically less improve the standard of living of their population and subsequently and that of helping them to help them or accompany them through their system and unfortunately many countries around the world are six weights by the way you type just if for Switzerland you are going to return you are going to
ir the countries that vietnam bosnia albania morocco the worst or south africa in any case these are countries that are considered that with which it is in the process of dealing at the moment that is to say switzerland want to import from these countries and by switzerland is going to help them to finance this operation it has found exporters in these countries so that foreign trade operas trade cooperation investments with these countries there is Switzerland takes place in the best
their conditions than vietnam tunisia south africa morocco serbia the office albania colombia bosnia ziggo unfortunately algeria greater algeria which is the most important country the most important country the largest country in the maghreb one of the largest country on the african continent one of the most important countries in north africa it is totally absent from this program supposedly because switzerland does not consider promoting its trade and investment
s with algeria as a priority in reality an economic report from the swiss embassy in algiers that algeria has obtained considers algeria as a country which is not its own priorityeritarian therefore in economic relations the ambassador that the Swiss embassy in Algiers which can provide information to Swiss companies which want to work with Algerian company there is no aid system while the policy for Tunisian companies Moroccan companies or that
from South Africa etc. and well there are devices to be precise or thanks to this instrument which is the sipo so Switzerland helps Moroccan and Tunisian companies which want to export to Switzerland likes Algerian resistance who wanted to export to Switzerland none be because Algeria is excluded it does not have a system so little is not considered a priority country Switzerland considers Tunisia Morocco as much more priority countries than Algeria in its relations
ations of in these businesses in its relationship of what with in these economic exchanges here in these foreign trade relations what is still serious and it has never reacted and it has never caused the Algerian authorities to react the economic presence of Switzerland in Algeria it is very very really very very weak as an article you will see that Switzerland is losing more and more interest in Algeria so it is one of the richest countries in Europe and it is disengaging from
 more and more Algeria or which are the nejjman figures for example bilateral trade between Algeria and Switzerland has fallen more  that is to say that Swiss imports from Algeria have fallen more completely therefore more and more complicated between Algeria and Switzerland Algeria has difficulty selling to Switzerland and Switzerland is disinterested in Algeria that makes me for example the Swiss guy Algerian gas in Switzerland does not even present it gas who bought or consumes it
sea ​​by the Swiss it is still very worrying very very worrying Algeria is losing a lot of market share in Switzerland and it no longer interests Swiss investors while Switzerland lives in the Cana remains an essential platform for financing international finance and for international economic cooperation which proves that the great Algeria is neither great than in the hydration of the Algerian leaders if we cannot even manage to int
eress a country like Switzerland we no longer interest the Swiss we no longer interest Swiss banks nor Swiss companies nor the Swiss authorities which as when we are supposed to be the most important country in the region and the most attractive country in the region of course there are political antecedents because of this problem well to follow Algeria the relations have not been good since and for many years in particular because of the affair of the Algerian process i
is on trial practically in Switzerland through the end which has lasted now for more than years and Switzerland does not want to bury this Algeria Bazarina affair what happened between Algeria and Switzerland the hearings like the judicial process which maintained at the level of of the Swiss federal package absolutely disturbs the Algerian authorities the Algerian authorities they have done everything to blackmail Switzerland etc but Switzerland has never stopped this judicial procedure
ire against the former minister of national defense and that's it and Switzerland never gave in it continues there is the content of making of there is the content of demanding camps to want to schedule the trial of hamza which should have which must normally have place in any case this year this year because the article from Algeria leaves which is which was published on March peak of tension between Switzerland and Algeria because Geneva refused to treat an Algerian major general when Switzerland asked the general
eral an important general called larbi the secretary general of the secretary general of the ministry of national defense to leave the country altogether because she didn't want him because there was a period of covid which had started in Swiss hospitals and they told him  here you go home quietly because you are going to continue to treat yourself there but we have Algeria leaving like the dates as we Switzerland put pressure to obtain d
important details on the legal prospects initiated against the fkonénef who have swiss nationality now wanted never wanted to answer the examples on the political tensions there are between switzerland and algeria warkina it was in february we talked about it algeria played part of its relations with switzerland because of the legal proceedings launched contracts have been reported since october the two countries are cold the ministry of foreign affairs
rangères addressed to correspondence at the Swiss embassy in Algiers to inform it of the Algerian state's desire to freeze commercial relations with Switzerland and from there to suspend visits and economic delegations  we know a service against changes in the procedure engaged rather initiated against general nasal that we talked about it car park algeria wanted switzerland to request the cessation of the legal proceedings which are scheduled which are the procedure here
from the court of complaints to the federal court of bern in switzerland so like switzerland really they are crazy about the algerian regime does not give in to its blackmail so political relations have deteriorated and because of this deterioration well economic relations have been strongly impacted but switzerland with a little pressure from algeria we could have flexed it could have questioned algeria is an important country a regional force my list of problems to but frankly
there is nothing to prove the fallen imports of and Algeria is not even considered a priority country for the Swiss authorities entered with regard to the promotion of foreign trade and economic exchanges and commercial exchanges with foreign countries
hello to all I am offering you today a short video on the year that has just ended in Morocco the year because you will see that it has been an absolutely exceptional year for the country you may be expecting me to talk to you about football or the cup of the world but in fact no this video is not about football I know that sport in general is particularly football it is very important in our current societies myself I like football a lot I know that
makes it possible to give emotions of joy and sometimes sadness but football in the end it remains only sport and for the daily life of Moroccans or Africans it does not really change much we talk a lot about sporting exploits in the media but the Morocco is in the process of achieving feats that make much less media noise but which are much more important in the field of economic development and that  on the other hand  is an area that changes the situation a lot.
ie daily population at the time when I am making this video the figures for were published by the Moroccan Ministry of the Economy for the first months so from January st to November st I do not yet have the figures for the last two months November and December but the trend is already very clear it is an absolutely exceptional year for Morocco and we are going to look at it in detail you surely know it if you know the country or if you have seen my previous videos Morocco
 is a country that has invested heavily in the industry in recent years and at the industry level the year is a record year for morocco in several automotive fields new record for the first time in its history morocco has exceeded billions of dollars in exports in the field this is simply historic if you have not seen my previous videos i simply remind you that morocco is today the leading car manufacturer in africa aeronautics new
record water for the first time this sector has exceeded two billion dollars in exports in one year we do not always know but morocco has succeeded in developing a large aeronautical industry moroccan factories participate in particular in the manufacture of airliners such as the airbus a textile new record for the first time the country's textile industry exceeded billions of dollars in export agribusiness industry new record for the first time this industry has at
ssi exceeded billions of dollars in export phosphate fertilizer and chemical industry new record for the first time this industry will exceed billions of dollarsexport dollars morocco is a big producer of phosphate but in reality the raw phosphate brings very little to the country compared to the transformation which indeed in the factories to manufacture fertilizers and chemicals like phosphoric acid to give you an idea at the moment where i shoot this vi
deo the ton of raw phosphate is traded around dollars while for fertilizers we are around dollars per ton and it even rose to dollars per ton in April the Moroccan phosphate industry is one of the examples I talk about in my video on the raw materials in africa which show how much it changes the whole fact of transforming the raw materials on the spot instead of selling them directly like that raw to foreign companies so you see it
z Moroccan industry is experiencing an absolutely exceptional development for an African country and we will now see that this is also reflected in a total paradigm shift in the mentality of investors in a recent interview the Moroccan Minister of Industry Riad Mezour gave a figure that has gone almost unnoticed by many but when you look closely it is a figure that shows how much the mentality of investors has changed in the country there
about ten years ago people who invested in Morocco put about twice as much money into real estate as into industry there were about all investments that were made in real estate and only in industry and that can be understood because you know real estate is considered a rather safe investment if you buy a house it can lose value or gain it but in general you are not likely to lose everything at once except if the
 house collapses or other disasters you will always have capital but when you invest in industry or in a factory it is not the same thing if the company goes bankrupt you can lose everything so to put your money in the industry you have to have a certain confidence not only in the company but also in the economic system of the country if you are in a country which is struggling to develop which does not give confidence investors will prefer to put their money
 very safe in real estate but if you are in a country in the midst of an economic boom and which has acquired credibility well you will see on the contrary that investments will turn towards industry and indeed in Morocco today this is exactly what is happening the trend its completely reversed and there is now twice as much money invested in the industry than in real estate saying the mentality of investors has completely changed as it sees that the industry
rie Moroccan is efficient and above all profitable and well the capital goes automatically where it is profitable and obviously it is completely normal outside the industry we will look at what happened in the other major sectors of the economy for the tourism sector and well it does not change new record for the first time the kingdom's tourist receipts exceed billions of dollars in just a month and we do not yet have the figures for November and December
but it will necessarily be more since the month of December is a very touristic month for Morocco here again it is simply historic the two previous years it was catastrophic because of the covid I had made a video on tourism in marrakech it was really depressing but there that there it's gone again and it's gone again in a dazzling way if you pass through an airport in Morocco at the moment you will see it for yourself agriculture so there I confess to you that I was expecting
 a disaster because of the severe drought that there was last year but obviously the agricultural sector still managed to pass the course without too much damage since we have a growth in exports of this is perhaps explained by the fact that water stocks and the level dams even if they dropped to a historically low level this summer they were still enough to get through the season and at the time when I am making this video the level of the dams has risen almost to the level of
e the previous year thanks to all the rains of the last few weeksbut it is clear that has sounded the alarm for the authorities and that is why water policy is now one of the main national priorities and that there is currently a lot of investment in new dams and new desalination plants building and construction then there  on the other hand  it is a sector which is slowing down and which has suffered there is a very telling indicator to monitor the activity of the const
ruction in Morocco it is the sale of cement when there is a lot of construction there is a lot of cement sales and conversely when the sector slows down cement sales also slow down and so November we already had a drop of more than sales on the year then the reason you know it like me on the international markets the price of building materials such as steel wood aluminum you saw it well it became a bit of madness so necessarily a lot of people
or companies prefer to wait a little to get started clearly the year was well marked by the rise in prices at the world level and we will now see how Morocco has borne the shock of this inflation I think that it has not escaped anyone the year to come to flow has been particularly difficult at the level of prices almost everything to increase wherever you are in any country it is impossible to escape it since it is a global phenomenon now the shock is when
 even different depending on the country so has Morocco been more successful in containing the rise in prices compared to other countries and well in fact it depends on who you look at if you look at Asian countries clearly not China and the japan for example have been much more successful in containing inflation on their domestic market so november there was only about inflation but if we look at it compared to other major regions and nearby african countries well there we see
on the other hand  morocco is still doing quite well prices have increased much more in regions such as the euro zone the united kingdom and the united states even africa is no exception tunisia algeria egypt no more inflation so november it is starting to be very problematic for the Egyptian population and here again we are going to say that we are staying within sustainable levels there are currently two countries where prices have literally soared mainly because of the collapse
their currencies are argentina and turkey you have surely heard of it it is spectacular inflation in one year for turkey i don't know if you imagine it is as if in november you spend euros per month to live and a year later in november to live exactly the same you have to spend euros it's starting to be very very complicated obviously inflation is not the same depending on the product there are products that increase much more than the other parties
particularly the products which are imported but all the same with such a level of inflation it is still very difficult for the populations to bear so in summary for the year which has just passed in Morocco the industry is developing very well tourism has resumed in a spectacular way unemployment is falling constantly for two years there has been inflation but morocco is doing quite well compared to other countries so does that mean that all is well in the moroccan economy and well
unfortunately not quite you know it there is always something that comes to spoil the party and in morocco the pet peeve of the economy is oil and more generally it is fossil fuels the country has made feats to reach an export level record but on the other hand it is greatly slowed down by an import energy bill which is also unfortunately a record in for the first time Morocco has exceeded the bar of billions of dollars in
importation on fossil fuels mainly because of the prices of oil  gas and coal which have soared this year you know that as soon as the war in ukraine started oil went above dollars a barrel and it remained for almost a month when I make this video it's calmed down a bit but the energy bill has been very high for all the countries that import oil  gas or charbon that is the main problem today
 to be resolved for Morocco so that it can then accelerate even faster in its development when we understand that we understand why the country is investing so much in renewable energies with solar wind and hydrogen Morocco's priority in the coming years is to reduce significantly drastic dependence on fossil fuels and we see this very clearly in the investments which are made for example on the production of electricity in the kingdom according to Irena the agency
e international for renewable energies among all the countries of North Africa Morocco is the one which has most increased its share of renewables in its national electricity network yet the other countries of North Africa also have a lot of sun even if it is true that for the wind causes it still remains better served so in France and Germany we have a lot of hesitation and debate on solar and wind power many people think that it is not really the right solution
lution for these countries and it is true that it can lead to debate when we see the efficiency of wind turbines and solar panels in these countries but in Morocco there is not even a debate to see quite simply because wind turbines and solar panels are much more efficient at this location we can precisely calculate this difference in efficiency by reading the annual reports of rte for France and the UN for Morocco the efficiency of a renewable park is measured with what we call the fact
load eur let's admit you have a park which can provide you with the maximum megawatt hour of electricity in a year obviously you are never going to have megawatt hour already because at night there is no sun during the day there can be clouds sometimes there are no of brief wind in real conditions you will only harvest a small part of these megawh and of course the year this park would have given you only mewatt hour in France so according to rte the sun and wind combined have had
 a load factor of on French territory in Morocco the same year according to UN data it was almost double the load factors in other words if you have to install a solar and wind farm you will collect twice as much electricity if you install it in Morocco that if you install it in France it is for this reason that this debate has no meaning in Morocco and that the government's policy is fully in renewables there are very large projects in progress that
I bring together renewables  hydrogen production and seawater desalination because all of that is very linked and I will have the opportunity to come back to it in a future video so reducing dependence on fossil fuels is entirely possible for the country and that is really the challenge major which can change everything in Morocco in the coming years when we look at the development trajectory of the kingdom which is really an exception in Africa it is clear if the country succeeds in overcoming this problem
theth frankly I absolutely do not see what will be able to stop the acceleration of the country apart from naturally a major crisis a catastrophe or obviously a war here do not hesitate to say what you think about it for your part in the comments and for my part I say to you very soon
welcome to the journal of economic intelligence the program dedicated to the behind the scenes of the markets in Morocco economic growth rhymes with Africa the Moroccans turn their back on Europe and bet on their continent to ensure the development of the country last spring the Moroccan community of economic intelligence to broadcast its new strategy based on the African Eldorado this strategy is based as well on the capacity of Moroccan companies to conquer markets in Africa
ic that on the commitment of the kingdom to support them our reporter john hutton wolf was in Morocco a few weeks ago he was able to observe the very offensive spirit of Moroccan entrepreneurs as shown in his report from Africa to Africa these workers who under de pons and assemble work for the Moroccan company Bouzid Shelly all the parts they manufacture are intended for an African construction site we consider that we Moroccans for years in this profession we have acquired experience
ience and expertise through in particulart the various collaborations with the European countries which titillates came to Morocco and we considered that we could we could legitimately serve as a transmission belt towards the south is to position Morocco as a relay towards these countries of West Africa which are brother countries which are African countries with which we share a lot the language of religious cultural references and misses a cultural proximity which can be re
prove to be an advantage for this large sme which makes millions of euros in turnover  half of which is in africa  a continent that it does not fear  provided that we prepare the ground by unearthing the right information we also have subsidiaries in countries with bosses of subsidiaries who work on a daily basis on I would say strategic information by being a member either of the Senegalese Moroccan friendship circle or others so information is everywhere whether at the level
institutions at the level of the mining or energy industrial sectors so we try to capture information throughout the sector but ten where he would also like to capture the attention of the Moroccan government on what can be done better to support Moroccan companies yes and I think that there there should be an awareness at the level of institutions and governments and supervisory ministries in order to be more in support of commercial enterprises
ours who need sovereign power to go to these countries because exporting to africa requires a lot of energy hafid elalamy founder of the sam insurance group prefer to turn to the private sector to find out about the competition his group employs people he is established in countries using economic intelligence firms which are present both in Morocco and abroad but often in Morocco with a fairly advanced knowledge and r
very advanced computer research allowing us to be alert to everything that is happening in the region and to have more precise information on the site that we are looking at knowing the African market these economic opportunities its strengths its players it is the ambition of the financial center of casablanca it is positioned as a hub for the east and west of the continent it is where not to fully occupy its strategic african dimensions its positioning in africa to play
er the role of entry platform to West Africa has done its job but not approved I have a little bit of the opportunities in the region and offer international institutions wishing to set up in this region an environment a business environment that is more reliable and the as fluid as possible to enable them to access its potential in global economic competition morocco's ambitions are being played out here in africa to win its place morocco is counting on its
national economic intelligence strategy well with me on this set abdelmalek alaoui hello you are managing partner of global intelligence partners is a strategy consulting company you participated in the development of this new moroccan economic intelligence strategy to their first question why europe why precisely africa africa and as a natural extension of morocco's economic ambitions and as you know europe has had a phase of severe downturn
last year which intensified with the financial crisis morocco projected itself towards its south because first growth was forbidden to it in the east as you know the borders with algeria are closed and therefore morocco had to be imaginative and deploy in this space strategic and the uemoa zone and even a little wider all of west africa where he feels legitimate in confidence in a strategic space where he feels good he is flowing early europe is what you felt
that the doors were closing or is business much more complicated today with the crisis in europe business is in the throes of change and we feel that europe itself is looking for a model the great debates on deindustrialization a certain number of very major subjects that aim to stigmatize companies that come to produce in the south are elements that have favored the tension ofmany economic actors who finally said to themselves that it was more
s interesting to be able to go to sub-saharan africa where double-digit growth is not sluggish as it is in europe and where moreover the markets are more open and where the future is much more promising from a point of view a collection of information is this continent africa is an easy continent it is not an easy continent but neither is it a continent where it is extremely complicated to collect structured information that is why we believe that the
s actors in the South are better equipped because they also understand the different social ecosystems and also understand how to collect information with very high added value from the actors directly we cannot trust the press in the same way as in Europe so it is very important to obtain primary sources  that is to say people who have qualified information and to be able to trace it back and as such I must say that companies and in particular e
n Moroccan economic intelligence companies are particularly well placed to be able to do this work so relays which are easier to do because there is this very close cultural side this is what makes the difference for Morocco I think there is a triple dynamic there is also the fact that many African countries are in a very strong postcolonial feeling and who want to work less with the former colonial powers with Morocco there are links here
religious vilization and extremely strong cultural proximity links as you know Morocco trades as far as Timbuktu so there is this proximity and there is also this feeling that Moroccans are first and foremost partners and not people who act like predators towards this economic space then so you make this new strategy of economic intelligence and you decide to go towards africa does it pass naturally to Morocco where it would count to what it
 it must be a movement that they are brought by the state so that everyone is behind this strategy we have a chance in morocco it is that morocco is built over a long time and the state has initiated a strategy which was called before diplomacy economic events of african strategy from the end of the years and it started with the financial sector then with telecoms today morocco telecom is present in five countries in sub-saharan africa it is substantial
and then it's going to many other companies until the music case is said that you have shown who is a big sme which today exports the manufacturing industry so I think it's emblematic of this transformation of Moroccan industry and this reservoir of growth that is available to the companies that are deployed in Africa so there we understood that they had the framework we can read or your economic intelligence strategy yet we saw there that the boss
 you said that there are ten we need help from the state why and on which sectors they need to be these companies you have a personality other than interior in the report which is also emblematic of the transition my and federate my is now Minister of Trade and Industry after having been a very big African boss so I think it is the operational translation of this African ambition of Morocco to be able to create this crossbreeding and this fertilization cr
between the public sector and the private sector and do not hesitate to seek skills in the private sector who know how to make Africa the state cannot all this is why we believe within the Moroccan association of economic sciences that drawing up a roadmap for a national strategy towards africa was the responsibility of the private sector we paved the way for the state to operationalize so what the state must strengthen to help these companies
there first of all to work on the question of intermediate consumption for exports there is a great concern it is that Morocco matters a lot for you to see re-exports therefore it must work on the national added value years by putting a whole administrative millefeuille which allow to haveexport incentives it must also work on the climate of export competitiveness and also allow  through a federating body of economic intelligence to all these companies
ised to be able to access qualified information federating bodies you mean a little on the model of France a kind of great internal delegate for economic intelligence whether they are interministerial that's it that's the model or not not at all on the model of article r in On the contrary  I agree  we think that Morocco must have a Moroccan model and the Moroccan model means that we must find our own economic intelligence systems in which all the actors have
interest in cooperating as you know the sovereign administrations the central administrations do not like to cooperate with each other so we must imagine a more flexible system which can take us forward and this more flexible system it will pasqua through the cooperation between the state and the companies and by the creation of a kind of two places where all the actors come together we think that the problem the first step is the creation of a big government data we should p
able to pool all the knowledge that is produced by all the actors it is considerable in Morocco whether at the level of studies at the level of strategy or at the level of a certain number of things which are produced by think tanks and by the scientific community we must be able to construct meaning collectively that is the whole ambition of this approach to direct towards Africa you think an internet type device which is accessible for everyone I
I think that a lot of debate on the question of data security at the moment is a subject that is recurring. I am in favor of Morocco being built on software autonomy  so that we have a Moroccan system made by the Moroccans that they are secure. which allow all public authorities and strategic actors in the private sector to be able to maintain a conversation we are today at the center of the conversation on Africa we need to have the means
ns of our ambitions thank you very much abdelmalek alaoui the show is over but as usual you can find it on france points like goodbye
  hello everyone and welcome to economic emergency after almost two years of conflict in Ukraine the global energy map has been completely disrupted the Rubicon having been crossed in particular during the explosion of the gas Nord Stream since Europe was forced to move towards LNG who finds himself in front of a boulevard  Morocco cannot remain impassive in the face of these changes and many alternative avenues to thermal energy are being discussed no
particularly renewable energies but also nuclear energy to talk about it we have the pleasure today of welcoming someone that you now know very well Mr. Oussama Ouassini who is an expert in triple action and economic intelligence Oussama also says hello economic because each time you bring us insight alternatives that we call the habit of hearing in broadcasts a little but stream which bring us down every time I have had enough of logic
 of the well-being of the duty to be quite there then could you give us a relatively quick overview of the global energy situation currently good as we have already said during the various broadcasts that we have together we have known since that indeed that the Russian oil pipeline food plus Europe we noticed that an evolution in the price of refining which passed from dollars to dollars we also know we also learned that now gas
increased the price on all gnr gas because the moment there is more oil in Europe we use lng all the more there is more oil and gas altogether so we switched to oil by boat which comes even more which must be refined elsewhere because the refined oil refining which existed in Europe was specific to Russian oil so as there is more Russian oil so the refineries of our more paper gas exists so we are starting to por
ter LNG from the United States then and availableyear too and we also started to develop the renewable days of the wind turbines the sun etc the nuclear power returned to the charge of something else also it must be understood that as I told you before at the level of the CVs attend the world they invest approximately weeks from oil indeed so they invest in the middle of billions of dollars per year between research investments for new deposits and the exploitation of these
 new deposits while now they are investing more than billions and that's billions that's what it's just to be able it's investment to seek new deposits we're talking about the north pole which would contain huge deposits indeed contrary to what they say peak oil oil tankers simplistic of productions and you could even notice if we take the history of oil history of oil prices sites from years ago for example if
takes you the peak the the lowest price the last three there is that of then of then the next lowest this is so I give an idea of ​​what will happen between and there we are still in a phase at high prices only still begin a descent to move towards therefore perhaps from and would even legalize on the deposits the investments there is only one country which has not only invested in for the discovery of new deposits but also invested it in the
exploitation of new deposits from this country to the world it is the russians and this is also the reason somewhere for this conflict which enters ukraine and russia i am there it is defined the question which remains now what is the part of the war which is currently it is that the share that each will take of this cake goes down billions of dollars in order to be able to have the biggest slice of the cake we must have a complete energy mastery so the question of this conflict between Ukraine and Russia
ssie there are two options either it is lucrin which finally wins the skull the weather the weather or the west wins at this time indeed will have good days ahead of it on the other hand if the Russians win again for the thermal for the thermal we often see November the planet moreover we already see that there are globally two economic blocks in any case not yet geopolitical which is constituted and which could be integrated into your energy reading since the bricks remain attacked
oil gas and on the other side it asks western with the united states which would rather push towards renewables so why the united states to reduce renaud there because it is very simple knowing that here is all their domination has often been based largely on the control of world oil unfortunately or fortunately it depends for each one it is that at the Russian level in the united states fossil energy they still have it for years maximum because when you know
very good as well as shale gas or shale oil its lifetime of the well is only the first two three years quite because in the first two years you have already exhausted more of your ecological problem profitability very expensive and as I say tutor often at war in economic war the question is not to win the steps of the market but to create the market so to be able to create the market therefore to win the market it is necessary to
  positioned at the level of a renewable gy knowing that at the level of fossil energy they saw the hand so they tried on the loss here it is the largest oil deposit that currently exists in the world which has not been exploited russian iran iraq brazil and the military coast indian between egypt eastern syria and you know very well so whoever will hold this is potential this is precisely potential will master the trillion dollars of charles cakes gave the economy n
is never only transformed energy so there is no energy there is no saving and if I very often take an example I remember very well in I believe I was invited to the head of government it was still on othmani it was and I had taken as an example I told him because he was looking to increase the tax base a little and me in this tax so I said as I told you I was one day invited at homehead of government is othmani to be able to talk about the increase in
 the tax base so there was a factor of excellent Moroccan economy very well known and I was part of this of this panel and at some point we will ask him the question and I said to them listen like in our religion there are five pillars if you increase the plate we have to become well industrialized and not very fast there are a lot of pillars but there are two that are mandatory energy and research is development I told him at the research level for a development you
there we leave them aside let's talk about energy and I gave as an example we are the world's leading exporter of sardines tons of sardines per year so you know this value chain very often we hear no industrial value chain and all that this chain of value in control not even why because if we take canned fish and canned sardines and sardines of course etc but canned aluminum sheet aluminum entrepreneurs
 Moroccans are not so stupid not to open our own knowing unfortunately if we were to open a factory for the manufacture of canned sardines so the manufacturing process of this console of this factory which cooks is in the United States in Western Europe in Eastern Europe or in china the manufacturing process and the bath therefore in aluminum is the same price on the stock market just add the transformation the added value so at this level the rules of the game are the same for filming even
I don't know that they are the countries but unfortunately if this preserve is made in Morocco my knife is more expensive than those made in Eastern Europe and more expensive than Western Europe so I say how to do it on the spot there is more there is no transpoint all that is very simple as in any industrial process energy plays a role and especially when you are a genius in a manufacturing process exceeds the cost price energy becomes a vital element of competitiveness again
ity then you imagine in europe where the energy cost there are cents of a kilowatt hour whereas in Morocco we are at cents of a kilowatt hour it is times so you imagine your energy cost it is European it is equivalent to your energy cost in Morocco so leaving you can never be competitive because there is one of the deaths of competitiveness upstream as I say we cannot say that we are an industrial country as long as the cost is energy is not below cents of
 kilowatthour it is at this point that we are like we are starting to be seen on radar level an industrialized so now what is happening in morocco we are subsidizing the energy cost yes like renewable energy moreover we are coming to morocco because i would like to mention the fact that morocco did not wait for the conflict in ukraine or the current crisis to begin a reform of its energy policy  in particular with the energy mix to depend a little less on electricity
fossil fuels we are introducing an increasingly large share of renewables so what can we say about the result can we take stock already we have to understand one thing the royal strategy in terms of energy makes him the king in his vision from the start when he is ascended the throne he had in his vision there were two poles the logistics pole why because we had to be more dependent on the ocean of world oil and gas prices so if tomorrow we could have
 or of our sovereign energy  we say no  we say that we can produce it automatically  so it can play a role in absorbing the energy blow at the level  on the other hand  for the industry as such  such as the automobile or aeronautics  these are in fact only tools for developing this market which port logistics is developed energy today whether it is the automotive industry the aeronautical industry or other but tomorrow it could be something else it could be artificial intelligence
it can be the industry the industry as quotas it is only an engine to justify the development of these two strategic friends of the royal vision of the energy infrastructure now at the energy level I personally pulled it at the wind level I did not believe it very much and I did not believe it very muchoops and even the current ceo of siemens says it in the washington post part he said that in our interview shot was not modeled so all the profitability studies of leo
link have been distorted by the fact that we have not integrated maintenance costs and fees etc. so in fact it is much less profitable than what we are told later I take an example of the space the neighbor next door he won that and a shareholder energética if take the course their course of the quran purse the cost on the stock exchange and the current course it is the same since the cessation of subsidies the sharpened course of technically it is not profitable at all now in Morocco why I agree
 and I would always like us to have solar wipes for one reason only  it's like I always said we have a trade balance problem yes and I would like the development of solar lingerie to develop in Morocco because I know that in terms of the use of housing or services we can easily reduce our dependence on especially that the energy bill and the highest bill in terms of currencies so if so for me solar remains an area
 profitable and especially especially within the framework of our trade balance to lighten a little difficult but you say that it is it can be interesting in Morocco as much for the global electric projection for the network as for the private individuals of the energy consumption or even more it is done at the level of consumption completely completely so already at this level we can have a huge guy there is also Morocco must position itself at the technological level when you have
z very well that the solar magic solar panels the research developed it is still in an embryonic state it is at the moment where ever to position itself to be able to develop by research and development so etc today I count the leaders it is the Chinese at the level of the Chinese holds at the level of the solar panels at the level of the raw materials and even at the level of the process or even of the types of agreement so what you are saying is that the energy policy carried out by
r Morocco for years is good you think foundations its vision to its objectives just recommend you to have more access to solar and a little less to wind power and to switch if possible to nuclear so yes then opening this nuclear breach so we know that it is a very closed club of countries which do not control armaments but the same as uranium enrichment there are very sensitive elements in the field it can be hijacked militarily if we increase the rate
  encroachment so it's a very club the countries that master civilian junuclear technology are not numerous for russia and in france there are united states etc maybe even china today I don't know it's exporting technology or not are we not there not in the process of leaving the energy song a little to move towards political change  that is to say that the countries which master this technology could accept that Morocco develops civil nuclear power if because
 that quite simply I would have always guessed at the cake now if a country is one of the big western poles or brix then Morocco especially I told you earlier I am coming back this war in Ukraine will give the I repeat why I told you I can guarantee you that by now oil will also go between dollars and dollars and less dollars in any case in the eastern navel half of the world and all that they will be spoiled to have dollar courses and the more that perils them
will have to have a difficult majority market which will be able to go faster in the development of other ecological activities it is starting to reduce their export volume from saudi arabia and russia which has just done recently so indeed they are doing everything to keep the price of a barrel at a high level so nuclear will not pose a problem in a rivalry scheme but now if we had to make a juxtaposition between what we said in relation to the world situation
  and on the other side the policy pursued by morocco for years what should morocco expect so we talked about the young people we talked about nuclear power we talked about oil when what should do thee Morocco to position itself by your and what should it expect me what your prospective here is prospective me what scares me is the years to come I am afraid that if Morocco and I invite the government to reopen the samir we are not going to come and spit or on refining dollars and co
same as I told you at the level of canning here is a very simple example that we can easily master more than of the value chain of scrapping we don't even use even though we are the world's leading operators it's a shortfall of that also makes me think of losing the cp also it can create jobs it can create an industrial ecosystem develop metallurgy I demonstrated by this example to the head of government that his energy we can never be a little
  industrialized so I'm coming back we have to reposition ourselves in terms of oil and become a little more competitive at least at least by rehabilitating the saint okay otherwise I told you about the years to come the prices also range between dollars and dollars the problem is that these are the prices of all the possible energies because what are correlated they had the price which was on the wooden side now there are two prices there is the price of the friends and you have the price and there again
e Morocco by vitraire between the two but looking at a relative neutrality it will be difficult more and more complicated at least to keep the refinery it is to keep part of the partial sovereignty that is what interests me the most it does not agree and also at the balance level commercial refining dollars per barrel that's a lot of money altogether and it wants to become a deficit i'm afraid that tomorrow our children in years in years see the father unemployed because of a bad
energy strategy because we missed this opportunity to do a little further I am afraid that in the years to come there will be people in Morocco which may be something else why because we are no longer involved in energy competitiveness on the world market so what you are saying is that if Morocco does not hear at the right time  that is to say now  the energy shift that would allow in a horizon of years to gain in energy competitiveness all the efforts that
has been deployed for years in terms of industrialization for the automobile  aeronautics and different types of industry will be doomed to a lack of competitiveness  not to say a global bankruptcy because indeed upstream we have not worked here we have not worked the question of energy is that energy there because after market conquests etc. it can be done energy is structural I don't know something that you can decree in one year in two years it's my
Now we have to begin this shift  I repeat what I said earlier if you want to become an industrialized foothold if you do not control the energy cost and I would even say more when we become an industrialized foothold the energy cost of which we process the manufacturing process exceeds these. huge so in fact therefore on a price which is already from the start four times more expensive than the lowest you have four times even less chance of having this and there I identified two pillars to catch up
this delay in what you said first is research and development in renewables for this in particular lamp generate enormous margins but we have engineers yes we have researchers we have all the gray matter we need there is no problem no only we have but unfortunately the pair by the hemorrhage how do we say intellectual etc the second pillar of competitiveness is the samir that is to say the refinery which would make it possible to sell the products derived from this p
oil at much cheaper prices for industry for automobiles for electricity production etc. what about gas what could become of gas at the level of lope you know that the current world production of oil is for a daily consumption of millions of paris per day currently we are running at millions of barrels per day making more than the production capacity that is to say that we are currently pumping into the reserves m
so when I went to get those millions more barrels a dayr why where does this idea come from it is thanks to or because of renewable energy that is to say that when we create more and more solar panels or wind turbines we use more and more oil at the chemical level for the material to be able to provide for the renewable management needs okay which is a bit paradoxical and moreover according to the people more in what it is so years we all
rnera between and million barrels per day don't forget i'm telling you it's years ok there i'm going to tell you one thing just to set up an oil pumping station it's between and years it's an idea what will happen during these five years it's that the demand will be greater than the supply I repeat and that's why I bet you that in the days and months to come the bet also at the minimum between dollars and at the maximum dollars so in a horizon of years years okay that's it
 numbers I'm talking in terms of numbers they're friends here so the government already has an idea of ​​what it expects so it's better not to wait four years in a forward-looking approach and not be in front of politics I've accomplished I have you now say no renewables and we consume a lot more oil so now natural gas so there is talk in Morocco of creating fasting regasification stations which will be imported from our Spanish partners
ls in Spanish maybe not because the gas personally no the very simple reason I told you everything depends on the outcome of this war between Ukraine and the Russians but hey we can't wait at the same time until we have the outcome the result is the even because as I told you the investments are not so sufficient at the oil level also at the gas level and even if at the renewable level you will need gas and oil because at the gas level whatever
be the situation me for me I lng you have to go by consuming you have to with it you have to consume homeopathic backpacks I can explain why if we make too much investment in lng storage platforms and watching the guy will be so cheap that we will no longer be able to repay the investment I'm afraid we'll get into the same problem as there was at the level so why would the price of gas collapse because quite simply the Russians or the brix side as they want s
i win they will want the old diggers to keep the same bet on the energy that will be used for the billions of dollars in so they try to keep a fairly low price which is more concrete than energy automatically okay at the lng gas level we have to position ourselves as that child that have the minimum to be able to effectively use as it moves rescue and as the adjustment variables that's like at the level of the renewable okay and if ever it's the West
t who wins why would it gas because renewables are no longer in use there are the elements that the UN has put in place  among other renewable energy it is doing how very well at the UN level they have prohibited banks from lending for investment or exploitation fossil fuels and you they only have the right to lend to renewable investments here and then today with all the ecological discourse there are ratings that are given there is a whole
marketing between countries you know me for personally me when we talk about the gironoubles there when I told you west in the five let's say they will have more than one fossil figure on it that means what is no longer worth exploiting to look for so we are really in a clash of the titans at all levels but the basely primary fire remains the energy by the way somewhere we have we have a west in any case the united states which is losing their fossil energy fall back
e on renewables so make up always ideologically must say that ecology save the planet etc but in fact it's just a plan b and on the other side we have countries which have all the resources to infinity at the fossil level russia iran iraq the bricks etc which do not want to lose completely who do not have brazil perhaps even eyes of the earth who do not want to lose this manna of the strategic wardrobe and who will do everything to fightrenewable energy and Morocco
so for the moment we will quickly say we have the image neither the other or there we have a little bit of there a little bit of the other and well must integrate in its energy strategy the two scenarios simultaneously ok so to come back to what you are saying so the Morocco must position itself and I invite I invite I invite the refinery to be served to reopen I repeat to you in terms of competitiveness the first competitiveness is energy competitiveness we cannot tomorrow say that we are an insane country
industrialized while at the energy level we are not competitive good no fight the real fight is energy everything else can come after all the capital that comes his majestic I had not understood the it was not assimilated his majesty understood well to live two things it is logistics and energy all the rest of the environment the industry it will come automatically when you offer the competitive factors logistics optimized automatically the rest while unfortunate
ment we government have focused on industries while we the real strategy is your independence both in terms of logistics and energy quite the rest is the market to take advantage of competitive advantages both foreign private factors international and Moroccan and that will go up everything naturally yes you add something before concluding to conclude here I repeat I do not want that in years in years the people who are working re
find themselves unemployed due to inadequate choices thank you very much a great pleasure once again we were we were surprised by the freshness of the ideas that we were proposing to you through a prospective reading which unfortunately is lacking I still don't know why because we may not have them good sington because it's a state of mind maybe day to day but in any case it's always refreshing to have a prospective reading that manages to identify the multitudes of scenarios and po
situate Morocco in relation to the scenario I have been doing economic intelligence for more than or years now and yesterday I had such a certain maturity in terms of this intelligence I will tell you one thing what is the difference between a war and an economic war there is no respite there is no truce there is no armistice all fields we come economic when you target your thing the main thing is to create more unemployed people and make people independent
ants at the country level you can do absolutely whatever you want on it and you can even create words indirectly by bankrupting the education hospital of many things so you always have to see that the first energy is an economic war again I also thank our loyal viewers and listeners who follow us regularly and I'll meet you next week for a new episode of economic emergency
among the institutions that contribute to the development of participatory democracy and civil dialogue in our country there is the economic  social and environmental council a constitutional institution independence the council carries out advisory missions to the government and parliament through opinions studies and reports on economic  social  environmental and advanced regionalization issues the council contributes to the evaluation of public policies relating to
tives to these areas to improve their effectiveness in the service of citizens the council can exercise its activity in two ways either within the framework of a self-referral  i.e. its own initiative  or at the request of the government or parliament  i.e. seized beyond its character independent the board also relies on the plurality of its composition and the diversity of their skills which reflect the richness of Moroccan society six members are divided into
s experts in different fields presenting to you the trade unions representatives of organizations and professional associations actors of civil society personalities at the head of certain national institutions this diversity is important because the attributions of the council are multiple it implies having a global vision on the different subjects and to gather varied opinionseds to engage in a constructive debate which is likely to reinforce the relevance of these opinions
 studies and reports the objectivity of its diagnosis and the applicability of the recommendations proposed as a space for dialogue and public debate between the country's various driving forces the council has a fundamental role in supporting and assisting the public authorities in taking the appropriate and useful decisions in the interest of the country and citizens who can also interact with the council and give their opinion and suggestions on any subject and this through
 different means of communication facebook twitter email etc
  hello everyone and welcome to economic emergency today we are going to approach a profession or an art it depends on the eminently important point of view for the success of Moroccan companies both nationally and internationally let's start first with the international for years or even already for more decades ago Morocco started a new economic dynamic through increasingly rapid industrialization and through the development of the concept of medina
 Morocco that we are trying to export internationally so to do this the work of diplomacy is not enough because economic diplomacy also involves an important role that Moroccan companies will have to play to convince foreign investors to invest in Morocco or to convince potential customers to the international import of Moroccan products and there the commercial profession is the paradigm of the commercial because it goes beyond the simple commercial becomes a hundred
ral and then nationally many business entrepreneurs complain of a shortage and a significant lack of talented and well-qualified salespeople and who better to talk about it than an expert in the field and so I am pleased to welcome sir first of all for having accepted our invitation thank you yours then you have an atypical career already internationally you shone before returning to morocco you were in charge of the commercial aspect of volvo in the united states during
years and you were awarded the prize for best global salesperson at volvo in the united states in sweden in fact it was old but compared to your performance in the united states and then you returned to morocco you created a support and training firm in the field of commercial management and everything related to behavior so this is really an extra abbreviated version of your background if you want to add a few elements you must not remain important in fact
t what you said is perfectly correct yes i started as a salesperson so i learned the relational side with the customer and that is maybe what we are going to talk about today this relational side which is practically absent today so i learned that and later i learned a lot I invested myself in research on all that is neuropsychology so and neuroscience was quite new at that time so I did a lot of research and a lot of I pr
practiced on the ground everything I learned to see if it was real if it worked etc and you did it in the heart of capitalism that is to say in the United States where it is the hardest to do it or the competition is the fiercest in fact I did it more late why because when I was commercial I did things instinctively I understood that to sell he the charms and his client and I had two ingredients that were natural so I have no merit is that I liked
 what i did i loved the volvo brand i loved my customers and so for me what was important was that when the customer came home that he left happy it was not very complicated so to that later i added the business knowledge side of it so i got i got myself thorough in all that is motorization safety construction of a car etc so I had a rather substantial background of what the automobile is that too it is a component which is today absent in sales representatives unfortunately
it's not their fault we're not going to blame them maybe i'll explain later so i married these two factors love for my customers and the desire to see them happy plus knowledge of my produit of my profession so not only what I was selling but my competition what is this market what is in it so by doing these things there so I did them instinctively I want to think that it was the most natural thing later I myself am launched into
s neuropsychological research and what goes on in our brain and how and it was after i realized what i was doing right what i was doing wrong and there today for years i have been teaching these things there in wheel things but for services for many things but I remind you that you have not only worked in the automotive sector even if you have also accompanied other automotive brands in the United States but you also work with the sector
  pharmaceutical and therefore the urlity of other sectors so just so that the viewer does not think that you are only in the automotive field no you are an expert in the dimension relating to commercial regardless of the sector you are able to adapt and do the same work yes in fact because my work today consists of looking into the human factor and as I explain very often it is the him is not even important in fact that is to say if you are going to ache
ter an iphone well the iphone it is good it is what it is now or the samsung mercedes anything when you go to buy any product this product there is not a variable it is what it is however if we have commercials we can clearly see that each end of the month it's the results are not the same we have while they are the same products before here we are we have stars who sell I don't know what times more than the others the average and the less good who do not sell a
enough etc who complain all the time so really you have to understand that the product and secondary factor okay so I am mainly leaning on the the human factor that is to say how I am going to charm this human being understand this human being adapt to this human being now that i sell cement  drugs or medical services or advertising  it's secondary  i don't need to master all the trades that i train in because i'm not a specialist.
of the product nor of the product that we sell  I am a human specialist and therefore I understand that as I have just sent a mailing to my customers this week and in fact it said what it said in a commercial transaction who is going to buy who is going to pay and who is going to decide in the three of course it's the customer and who knows that we forget here in our country it's the customer when we go to buy we tell you I have this that that and we forget your temperament your your state of mind your mentality
we always repeat the same things about the product because it sticks it's not like that so we have to be the one who will decide it's the human so if I understand the human here I made the journey another thing that I would like to add if you allow me is that the human factor is it's the multiplier effect as I often say it's if you're not good as a salesperson it's you multiply by whatever the quality of the product you multiply by a bad salesperson so that's the m
best car brand the best phone brand but I'm bad I don't want to work with you it's over no matter the quality of the product it doesn't matter so if I understand correctly there are two elements there is the constant and the variable the tent is the product that must be respected  that is to say that the salesperson must do minimal work to know the qualities and virtues of his product  which requires developing a form of general culture around his product by
because earlier you were talking about the automobile in fact to understand the motorization of the mechanics etc. implies the salesman who sells the automobile must be able to become a little bit of an engineer a little bit mechanistic in any case that is to close his product but once that fact  we must move on to the variable dimension which is the human factor  that is to say the client with all these constraints  his mentality  his state of mind  etc. and this is where everything comes into play because technical mastery
  of a product many salespeople can do it but mastering the human factor really does itt is work that must already be done on oneself to be able to interpret  make profilin and marry the needs of the customer and there in Morocco contrary to the reputation we have of being good negotiators in the bazaars where we arrive to divide price by et cetera in fact when we talk about the company many complain about a shortage of talented salespeople series
ux mastery in this dimension that you mentioned is it true or is it a little exaggerated which is a shortage of good salespeople lack good I would already answer with yes absolutely and there is a big shortage of salespeople but I would like to come back to this that you said there is the mechanical product knowledge aspect etc or in for example in the format this title I must know the molecules the competitors all that is still the human factor because the information is there but
does the salesperson make the effort to delve deeper into all this information to master that so once again it's the human factor already he's the human so that means that yes the training is there but we find today that when we go to see a given product whether it is a refrigerator or a watch or a TV we will tell you the top top top top information which is generic and banal but there is no in-depth so if you say ok which ok which gen
re stereo would go better with this television we don't know if you say ok I have a back pain what kind of suspension you recommend to me no idea who had this stereo made in this car no idea so that is to say we only know what we taught us or that we hear every day everything that can be said on a sales leaflet should not be a vocalized leaflet because someone who is capable of responding to the subtleties of detail that would possibly be of interest
t the customer and so now we come back to the shortage so you answered yes there is a very scarcity of adventure profiles and well trained so this is due to what is there a problem in terms of the training of salespeople are the schools do not quite do this  it does not quite meet the needs of the market or is it a problem of psychological blockage of conservative at the level of mentalities which means that what considers itself as does not necessarily want to seek out
years the details as you explained earlier ok but in fact everything you said is true it is the result of everything you said but I come back to the word talent as Jacques Brel said to me talent I don't believe in it it's just sweat so it's not a question of talent if you are involved in your job I always imagine a salesperson today who sells paint or I don't know what and who isn't involved that is to say it's like
me someone who wants to learn to swim but who only throws out his little toe to touch it's not that so it's like if we become a doctor or we become I don't know what we have to get involved to be at the top of ourselves okay so it's this involvement that is necessary now for the shortage well it's it's generational things have changed a lot today and the sales side a man or woman to woman or human to human has changed because we humans have changed so from my
 analogy which is not well researched I cannot say that it is a perfect science but my analogy is that for I don't know a hundred years things have started to evolve on the industrialization side etc. for years or years we have developed the top side our pc which captivated us but before that there was the family and relational side that is to say I imagine that years ago even when I was a child years ago and well grandmother diagram we met practically every day I
 say times a week why because a father had the capacity to manage a family the woman did not have to work they had two three children so the woman had a lot of time so she could see that sister her grandmother her cousin etc and their children come and so on so there was really a mix in the family we were very rubbed against each other over time today things being so complicated two parents who work marbles cannot benot enough
do not want to manage a family and have vacations buy a nice house etc so as the mother works the father works we have more time to see our sisters our brothers our cousins ​​so the human bond the social bond has faded we have we have less tendency to meet people who have the same attractions as us and centers of interest so on the one hand and later of course came the smartphone which now today has the information we want and the world and the universe we are looking for in
our pocket getting out of it meeting people talking and then before the internet saying when we were talking to people also managing the emotional dimension by the look facial expression with the internet the chat etc in fact we are going on a non-verbal linguistic Sunday but we there is more the emotional dimension  that is to say direct physical contact  exchange of gazes  etc. so indeed it is itchy but my objective my question is this change that you mention in terms of links f
friendly at the level of the new technology which has to isolate people it is valid almost for the whole planet in any case for the most developed countries and the emerging countries but what makes that despite this factor there are still countries capable of produce good sales people that we have we can't do it so i'm going to say that personally i worked in the united states for years i wouldn't say that there are good sales people either so i can't talk about singapore
 china i don't know the united states morocco here i and well the united states i know morocco well and well you know when i joined volvo in the united states there were three other sales people one was not bad two were really bad and they had been there long before I therefore had years of experience and the other years and it was the two worst the one who was more recent was better and on the contrary in the United States for example the sales people have the worst reputation the reputation of the manipulators
is able to sell anything but for some that's what it means to be a good salesman so it's important to also mention the ethical dimension yes but the electrical dimension and what do we mean by good salesman is he a good liar and is he a good scammer was he someone who manipulated people and said anything to sell personally that's not my definition a good salesperson is someone who is charmed who listens who gives you what you need
it brings you changes and in addition it builds your loyalty because we are all customers so if I find a good port I will come back to it it must be a good restaurant a good car watch showroom clothes so the idea is not in front but in front and resell and resell and resell then to bring back external people  that is to say the recommendation if I am satisfied with this showroom I can propose it to my wife who will propose it to her girlfriend and who will propose it to her husband who will bring safari and
 that's it that's exponential growth so that's a good salesperson because in the course that I teach I show very simply that the goal is to work less and earn more how we're going to do that it's because people will recommend me and what I explain to young businesses today listen you will never earn this money talking to those who come who come in through the door and who start to say ok explain to me that explain to me that that's a tiny contingent
e and small that from which you will not be able to make a big profit that is to say he is seeing you another another another another on the other hand if a customer is super satisfied he likes me a lot he sends me his brother well he is the one who made the sale absolutely so the brother comes it's already sold informalized here there is no energy to spend the guy he is happy to have found a good port so me what I teach is how to get from a single human being to get a whole network and like jexp
often every human is a portal to another network that you would never have known otherwise so every human is a network that has a network that has a network that has a network it's infinity it's exponential so why am i going to rack my brains i'm building loyalty who can bring me back a forest quite so by the way I had this image in mind while you were talkingfinally the customer who comes in a little bit the customer who hides the potential market is that you shouldn't see it only as
e a client while waiting to talk about the remedies that we can import when you mentioned the generational break of change in the technological environment which makes it more complicated to relate and the human factor so not your experience if I ask you the question to know in Morocco what are the biggest blunders that seem to you to be committed by salespeople and who could very quickly and who are fundamental and monumental guys ok well there are more
urs the first is that they do not deepen in the general culture of their products of their profession of their sector of activity therefore a school generally not much they know the superficial things that is to say titles etc here is the brochure exactly and again because very often good I had the privilege of accompanying a few companies and precisely when a new product comes out they are given a brochure on this new product well you can believe me that practical
only none reads this brochure none I'm not saying a few none so what we are reading more today so there is not this personal involvement in personal success we want the customer to buy and that's it's all the second is that we repeat the same things  that is to say  whatever the profile of the client  we don't even try to understand it  we repeat these titles that we talked about  we will repeat to you  for example  shoes  an apartment or on a car or on
a television but these are things that are generic so whoever the customer is  we don't try to understand what the temperament of this human being in front of me is and what he thinks about  what are his values ​​and his needs I distance myself from my need because if he's asking for a tv he needs a tv so that's what i mean is if he's an elderly person maybe he just has a sight problem maybe he needs a bigger screen or so maybe that's it
anointed there yes so that's why the word need I don't know if it's the best I allow myself to resist this word a little because precisely why because the French side of the thing and the French have taught us for sale and in my opinion it is not the right way we have been taught this word to detect the need I hear all the time but what has it detected there is nothing to detect if I come to buy a refrigerator well there is no detection I tell you I'm going chilled
misser so there is a nuance maybe he means something else with this but me i want to get away from that me what i am trying to detect is the mentality of this customer i.e. if you talk to me i am going to buy a fridge what i want to spend a lot of money am I open to your proposals am I not open to these proposals am I looking for the cheapest and dare not say it do I want to show off but in fact I have no money a lot of
 things that's what I'm trying to detect so to get to that you have to listen to this customer you just have to be neutral on the other hand what we do here in Morocco is that whatever the nature of the customer we repeat things to him and I what I call that's you're giving him you're giving him a punishment that's to say there you go Mr key we wanted it was the it's this this this this this this this this this this this this this this is the information go sort it out and come back when you have ideas this is
  not like that no me I'm going to listen to understand and according to what I understood from this human being I'm going to tell him here you are looking for that this one at the best stereo the best outputs barbapapa it's no longer in this street that is to say there it's advice that is really useful and personalized and i always give the analogy of the doctor for me a commercial it is still a doctor and what do i mean by that is to say when you come to the doctor if you tell him i have pain here he d
it's not here's the medicine or else I have all these medicines here's what I studied during these years no he listens to you you have to finish talking he asks you questions to better understand the nature of your discomfort blabla etc and sometimes he doesn't not allyour answers he tells you is going to do analyzes so the more I understand the more I can be precise in my prescription and well it's the same thing I understood that this guy wants a TV but who is in a very bright room so I have to
s give him something that or the black comes out more but he spent money but the size but but but based on his sir I offer you this which gives that and that which gives that what do you think it is up to you to see but it's that's the advice but it's not just giving information like you said read a brochure and it's up to you to sort the information that's the second degree already it requires behavior a little psychological a little listening a lot more listening for the words of the f
well  that's the hardest thing  we'll come back to that  that's the hardest thing  it's listening  adapting and we can talk about it. are really bad at the hacked side of what we were born in any case me I was born during the years when our parents told us we have to say hello we have to smile a kiss to the grandmother to the neighbor I don't know what today
 we don't even know how to say hello okay so when we go into a store for example or into an insurance or something like that we are not greeted with hey welcome we are happy to see you welcome what can I do for you from the blessing there is none of his coldness in the we are really we feel the saying we make you feel that you really don't hit the system what do you want yes what can I do for you and it's not really service enough really d
e torture so and of course when you make me feel that way I am less able to ask questions what I say to myself if I ask questions yes he will annoy I disturb him etc so the welcome hello with a neutral and human smile everything we don't know how to do that and we know that such as the American ladage deal a eve that when you're strong it means you don't have a second opportunity to make the first impression so the first impression if I get into my store
 and I don't know there you created the tension okay when it's very simple I fill in a very simple thing when I have it retested  that is to say when I know people are soft or something like that and they say yes there are people who don't like we don't do that you say hello with a smile and you give a little space after a while you say take your time if you need anything I'm here it does that says we recognize your presence you we are happy that you are
ez there etc etc and if the customer is waiting we go to his place after two three four five minutes we say do you have any questions if everything is very simple it is but that it became superhuman today and then yesterday off we were talking about something I would like that you share it with our spectators the relationship to space also which has a psychological character what actually when you have a family who arrives with children in a sales office etc if there are only two goats there are
no other elements that I would like you to talk about you can scare away the customer because in fact the comfort side is very important there are several things that is to say that you mentioned the chairs imagine that I come to buy an apartment with my wife and my child is bored will he let me concentrate not at all and what do i have more important than this child and so i know i will suffer martyrdom if he is he is bored so i always recommend
to my clients to have a space for children that is a little big it is really a small investment that is worth the effort so it is absolutely necessary to do that the number of chairs you have spoken about very often when you come to buy a car or an apartment there is only two chairs but in fact very often you bring back your grandmother your brother your cousin and there if there are four or five of us well if I came with my family and I see that they are standing up my conscience does not let me
concentrate because I tell myself I am trying to manage my problems or radish how to say in Arabic but my brother who he is not mI focus and my depth in this transaction so it is important for the trade that it is important that the salesperson face pay attention to all these things and who take the comfort and the atmosphere he creates very seriously that's on the one hand there is also a study that was done in the united states which showed that the comfort side was
 important so that is to say they did they created a showroom where they welcomed customers who were going to buy I don't know what and in his case they put very uncomfortable chairs uncomfortable hard plastic chairs etc and they did the same with customers who were installed in really very comfortable wealth traps they were very comfortable and well they saw that the closing rate had gone up from to so that means that our comfort is important
nt and that I show it to my so when I train I tell them listen imagine that I give you this training now stand up here I'm going to tell you the same thing and how much you're going to remember practically nothing because when we're not comfortable I'm in pain they said very often I tell you when you have a business to deal with a client or a friend a friend you have a good idea you want to tell him something do you say come on let's stand up at the vs
away from the street the other time you see there we go to the coffee ah we have the coffee we are good there we can discuss and the biggest business in the world is handled where in the best places in the best golf courses and my restaurants etc so there has an atmosphere side so let's forget the fact that the transaction is numbers there is an atmosphere side if you don't bring this tadpole this situation of overall comfort comfort not only physical but comfort in emotional terms in psychological terms
ique etc if you don't do it there isn't we won't get there if I understand correctly in fact it depends on a few small details that is to say that here I would like to address the question that I am remedying in fact perhaps it does not need much apparently to solve the problem and improve the performance of our sales representatives in Morocco to grow that it should be good because there is also the question of resistance and therefore what must be done concretely to unblock the situation in Morocco because we
has people actually that talking to talk and so on do they only come up with small details or does it appear to be small details but it's much more complex so when we talk about god retail sales that is to say if I'm selling a car or a pc or an armchair well in fact it's this armchair that makes up this pc if you can explain to me what's in it and I need it that's really a big piece of work and done by the product so you have to ju
ste that you are an added value and I always explain it and that's what I explain the toboggan effect the toboggan effect what is it if I'm excellent you come to my house it's like going into a toboggan you can't stop I'm so good from these pretty until okay because it was really a magnificent course there is the side where you have no added value you have to you are useless I'm going to buy this tablet I'm going to ask you all the questions it's me
who makes the effort so for me it's a parallel thing you come in and there's when the commercial really sucks and it's there it's as if I was hanging on I was going up to the Himalayas the summit is me I have to fight the nullity of this commercial to be able to buy this thing that I need so I of course promote the slide effect do I do that now is it small things yes there are little things like reception it's a simple thing we're going to learn and then I'll tell you
have the human develop procedural memory which they call muscle memory in the usa is that when you do the thing you repeat so i do exercises with welcoming and until you it becomes natural for you because you have if i have ever welcomed because I'm ashamed because it's not my culture because all the people around me are like that it's very difficult for me to change even if it's a banal thing so we're going to train them on reception until
let it become natural and in fait they will reap all the good things from this beautiful welcome that is to say as soon as they start doing it they will see that people are yeah they will see that customers are happier they are less tense than the customer experience and the seller experience loved etc so everything will be fine now where does it all come from it comes from the mentality of the mindset so we before moving on to the practical sides I always go through the behavioral and mental side
 okay that means what we have to convince and i always give an analogy i tell someone that imagined that you are a muslim and your friend who is norwegian is not and now you want to convince him to become a muslim if you start telling him side you have to do your ablutions like that you have to do that you have to pray like that and accent you can be sure he won't do it why because you skipped the most important part which is the faith part cro
yance so it has to come from him so before we start showing people how to do the quest i need to change their mentality so i'm working on that first on we're gonna shake the beliefs we're gonna really erase them and we're gonna help them see the things differently once they understand it's like that Norwegian now that he understands he's the one who's going to start asking how I should do this here he's going to stay you put them on the rules now that's the job so before you
talk practice talk beliefs faith behavior a new vision of what a salesperson's job is then there are two elements there is firstly an effort that an effort of open-mindedness that salespeople must make to change their mindset etc and get people to competent people to help them but also the role of the business manager who should perhaps better value the commercial profession and invest in training in human capital in the commercial profession
cial because for many many I don't do but let's say for some business leaders for a salesperson like I bring to you  that is to say no matter his background etc as long as he arrives before as long as he makes a number then perhaps the role of the salesperson should be revalued in the very mindset of the ceo of the dg of the shareholders etc there is a little blood you know you are not wrong but you are not right there is a side where yes the company must do such and such thing p
to enhance this position to make it easier for him  etc. of course because you know  as I often say  that it is a sentence that comes from an American adage your strength rests on your weakest link so now if management is not good it is a weak link of course the company will not succeed now all the links must be strengthened so on the one hand yes the management and that's why I work a lot with the companies the dg the bosses the etc to create
er an atmosphere conducive to the purchase of agreement very important now there is also the role of the human that is to say me I am commercial if I do not sell it is me who does not win so I must get involved in my own success now if I did not know it and if I didn't know there was an alternative it's normal I'm not going to evolve so now if we train these people there they have to involve now very often what I find is that a lot of companies train but not
very well that is to say I tell them listen if you want to train me on anything for example on digital marketing I like but if you don't accompany me don't take a good time until I'm on track it's no use nothing you're going to teach me something you disappear and I always give the analogy of someone who's going to take up playing the piano if I show you how to play for two hours here and I'm leaving and I'll be back in a week you haven't practiced no there isn't
s of progress it is absolutely necessary to support so that is to say the companies of the companies must invest in a course of support not training the training remains theory because we do not touch between even if we do workshops it is very good and certain members of this team will have a click and be launched on its own there is no problem others must be accompanied mostrt so we have to create courses that start with an immersion where I see how
t the company works then we move on to the training side then to support in the field and I do it with a lot of companies I go out with the salespeople I observe them we do coaching what does that mean that coaching doesn't mean that I know how to do it better than him I always give the analogy of Messi but if it's a very good day of football but he has a coach and the coach has the privilege of seeing him from afar and observing him and when he is not conscious and he tells him that's it
how you can become a better messi so that's my job my job is not because I accompany you selling cement it's just saying that I know better than your name I can help you to be a better version of yourself so all that course is excellent is important there you have people who will stand out boom there we are off to a good start so there is the involvement of the sales person himself and the strategy the strategy of the company so we are going to conclude with the international because it is a su
I am also important and where the salesperson has a commercial role to play in this sense because indeed what you explain is that the dimension of the salesperson goes beyond the profession itself it is the whole company which must think in commercial terms accompanied here is a whole chain then internationally we are confronted with other cultures  other mentalities  etc.  what must the salesperson do to learn to embrace and adapt to different values ​​and different men?
tities does it require particular training a particular effort when we call the communication in your cultural etc ok the training is excellent very important so I have trained a lot on that which I told you there is the behavioral side we are going to see the typologies of beings human  that is to say whatever the culture because I very often explain in the human there is the side which unites us all  that is to say me and a woman in Vietnam or a gentleman in Gabon
we have certain things which are the same that is to say the three parts of our brain that is to say I say very work given a simple example I tell you you if you I tell you spell casablanca in reverse you will be lost why because you had to go from one side of your brain to another that's all beings so I'm going to show you how to sell without going through that side because there if you think you're blocked so there's that side there's another side that
 is precisely cultural and even in the cultural that is to say my training that I do in Morocco does not work in Vietnam because I do not have the strings that I can pull so how am I going to do it I have to go to Vietnam okay I have to go to vietnam or live you see now you are doing several to talk to the people there I am going to have more for an immersion that you said earlier absolutely me I am training here I trained in Algiers I trained in Africa I trained in the States
atsunis so I know that if you don't understand the culture you won't be able to speak the language so we talked about the first part which is universal so you have to master that then you have to immerse yourself in a culture okay I work today with a pharmaceutical lab which works a lot in Africa I made the trip and I see that now he communicates perfectly because they are people who live with these people there you have to understand the humor their wit their i
There are many things that can cancel a sale because you can do something totally innocent. I find that offensive  and that's even in Morocco tomorrow  so and also there is a man-woman side  for example  an Arab Muslim woman is not like a Swede so even in the man-woman side there are subtleties and susceptibilities to which we must pay attention  we must understand them and there is the third thing which is the human side  that is to say individual.
so that too we have to master it we always see that when we have children even if we have two children and it is not if they are both boys well they do not have the same temperament at all so we have to understand how to communicate with every personality type what i call copsines so immersion is important so if I summarize quickly there are three strata or three levels to master there is the first it is the common denominator and all of humanity and exact it is r
related to the brain and etc there they made me in euros psychiatric the second element is the culture the cultural environment the traits of humor the humor the language etc and then the third level is the individual scale because each person is unique each person has their own temperament and therefore this is the three that must be mastered take into account in an agreement synergy approach therefore where the interest may be to encourage at the level of public policies like other regions the
promote the travel of young people exchanges take a long time to send them to latin america in china in japan in europe etc. to bring other young people to meet young people in morocco etc. so this is perhaps also the interest it is a mobility of young people and to encourage the mobility of young people oh yes you said the most important thing travel is the best culture it's better than reading a book so yes so I can only say yes yes because it's abs
olument important traveling changed me I'm sure he did he did the same for you so yes that's the most important thing and especially if we're going to do business in a country I think trying to go there right away try to sell it's going to be quite tricky going to do an immersion than being the culture and much more important we do fairs etc it's very important but the more time we spend then we will understand the codes that are invisible here in Morocco god knows that
and we have codes of it that are invisible and that's why I tell a lot of companies when I returned to Morocco years ago I was trying to sell my training and a lot of people were shocked by my approach because they were used to the approach French which is very procedurally rigid with a lot of texts and a lot of things and mine was much more American psychone ground but really I would say in fact I recommend Moroccan training it is
what I say precisely because I do not want to be neither American nor French nor Moroccan nor Chinese perhaps French training works in France but we have spoken precisely about the cultural side very often I recommended to my clients to carefully consider the choice of trainer because a French trainer who is going to teach us apartments or cars or tables beforehand will give codes that are precisely not suitable because he himself does not understand and he cannot
not understand as I myself have to you that I will not be able to train people in vietnam because I do not know the culture these people there if have not understood the invisible codes of Moroccan can in no way teach us how to sell to Moroccans maybe their system works French to French but French to Moroccan it doesn't work anymore I found that many trainers and students who took his classes had been formatted so the trainer tried to be yapping
he was French and therefore he was like a Frenchman but it was not natural for him and whoever was listening take a message still Franco said that he is not suited to him so both of them were in a kind of mascara in my opinion which could not succeed in any way because that when you sell amstafa fati mohamed these techniques are really not going to work and when i was training young people and i was talking about my system exactly yes but we were told and i really want i saw this this lu
eur of despair in fact because the system that they had instilled and instilled in them could not work after minutes you have to give an invoice you have to say that you have to say sir and there the and I don't know what the green customer the red customer etc. things that were so square that are not suitable so really it was important to reconsider the choice of your trainer and for me if you are going to train Moroccans you have to either a Frenchman who has lived in Morocco who understands you
there and who knows us well or simply a Moroccan so I to conclude in relation to this aspect there so it is good to discover other cultures to make benchmarks of ddifferent methods on a global scale but in the end it would be necessary to bring out a Moroccan way of training salespeople  that is to say to Moroccanize perhaps by borrowing methods and tools but to integrate them into the mental intellectual cultural soil of our Moroccan universe in order to produce
re and to train salespeople made for Moroccans and then that does not prevent us from training salespeople made for Vietnam made for elsewhere depending on the objective that we have in racing and I would like to add something precisely my company personally it has always been called natural that years since I have why it is selling naturally therefore not only a Moroccan dimension but individual dimension that is to say as I explained to you yesterday what is selling how is it
uoi what I teach me what I teach is selling in nature no that means what does that mean it's as if I taught you French ok and I taught you everything I taught you syntax grammar conjugation etc you learned to speak I I'm not going to tell you what to say to whom when you have spoken  do what you want to form the sentences now I teach you the art of selling the really fundamentals I don't call them sales techniques but the fundamentals
mentality of commercial excellence once you have taken them it's as if you mastered the language of Molière now we are going to say what you want to whoever you want when you want according to your character because I couldn't sell like you are not going to sell like him that's that and that's the natural side thank you very much karim kadir invitation and for all this advice and insight and I also thank all the people who followed us and I'll meet you as usual
see you next week for a new episode
  in Morocco has remained in the order of magnitude of the large developed countries even if we do not have the same means but there are countries like Argentina where the inflation rates are close to them so first of all we must be pleased that state interventionism is allowed to control inflation but also the exchange of the dirham in relation to the dollar and the euro for example and here again Turkey for example has experienced significant devaluations so from this point of view we must request I think that the reaction
tion that we had to give confidence to operators to allow them to have real confidence in our economy in its stability in political stability and this is what means that our operators are in a certain optimism a relative optimism despite measuring it despite the the global conjunction but even global operators come to look at Morocco and settle here it is good that we still have advantages and one and beautiful things to offer and the finance law
comes to reinforce all of this since the main element is that we have a convergence of linked to for the vast majority of companies and these are rates which are commonly accepted as competitive rates at the global level the challenges which await us for the year without enormous now which would be I would say desirable and what I think would be recommendable is first of all to continue the efforts that have been made until now on social protection reforms.
 health reforms education reforms that's that those are the fundamentals because I think first of all to be in line with the speeches with the speech of his majesty and so that we can go to the end of the reform of the protection of social protection at the same time it We must try to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels. I believe that here too it is an important subject. We are fortunate to be a country which has  I would say  solar and other energies.
 other things and therefore I think that we must manage to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels at the same time one of the challenges is to remedy the water shortage there I think that the minister of the team thinks and we have case he has already committed a lot of investments in this direction a lot of reforms in particular the connection of this beautiful with Bourgueil the establishment of a certain number of desalination stations that I thought was important and last point and for
 for me it's a wish I wantis that the government can work a little on reducing gender inequalities I believe that in many countries in the world which have given priority to reducing gender inequalities they have gained a lot of growth points I think that the major challenge today it is the presence of the state it is the financing of the action of the state I think that it is a challenge which is vital which strategic and even during this evening's debate the big question which is being considered
today from where the state should seek financing we are talking about innovative financing but we know very very well that they could not revolutionize the way in which the state had to drain revenues and we are also talking about fiscal references but also it has been highlighted that the tax structure current situation could not be stressed more for more revenue I think that is the major question but in the meantime the state could count on the com
behavior of economic societal structures to try to create wealth  create added value and possibly mitigate the role that the state should play but we tend to think about things that are very  very long thermists for reforms that should constitute today the guarantee of the sustainability of the presence of the state applause
  this conference on economic diplomacy I think that it comes at an extremely interesting and important moment and above all that it is happening here in Morocco which is playing a particularly interesting role in this area we spoke here and it was obvious that it there is a lack of integration in the median euro zone especially in terms of southern integration and since for most of the southern Mediterranean partners it seems as if there was only a north-south axis
t this integration and the exchanges above are missing fortunately we have some examples of what we could do I referred here to the success of Dalgermain here in Morocco and also the industrial zone next to the Swedish canal in Egypt which are examples where with international investments we make an industrialization which helps to go up the staircase of added value towards sectarians of higher added value and therefore it can be done to serve the market
that could not be done for an economy confined within Morocco or within Egypt  these are investments for a wider Holomeranian integration zone  but it also happens that Morocco  I think  is playing in the game especially interesting because by its vocation and the effort that has been led by Moroccan diplomacy during the last Georges say even decades not just years we are in the process of building an integration that will
a beyond the Holo-Mediterranean zone because it is obvious that Africa must be integrated into with the partners or the Mediterranean and there is a particularly interesting game that is being played specifically by Morocco by making a bridge between the Holo-Mediterranean zone and Africa from the west especially and sub-Saharan so that exchanges occur so that investments occur which always pushes to say that there is finally the world will be organized
  in large areas of integration in the americas in the eastern saw etc. and the note that certainly an african euro zone where the obedience is really at the center and must therefore fulfill as morocco already does this this role of bridge and facilitators of exchanges at the level of trade but above all at the level of investments that can produce pockets of work for sustainable and interesting economic growth for all the partners the debris different countries

this program is brought to you by the central guarantee fund hello and welcome to tpm universe in this rather special period due to the crisis linked to the cut which continues to penalize many sectors both nationally and internationally the good news relating to the entrepreneurial ecosystem must be highlighted and appreciated at their fair value it is for this reason that one winter you are sme has chosen to return to the launch of the app
recent call for applications from the startup acceleration program mine to boost the initiative led by start up morocco and its partners targets start ups and disputes with innovative solutions based in seven countries including morocco the current crisis has not altered the commitment of startup morocco in the vocation is to support and accelerate the development of startups we believe that the current health crisis has demonstrated that startups are essential because it has pro
poses innovative solutions which revolution of lévis which transforms industries and which are very adapted today compared to what we offer what happened is elsewhere in the world in fact there is really an increase made of investments in the startups which succeeded still being able to offer interesting solution sites that were able to save the industries where I put lives in the context of this health crisis for us it was completely natural to p
to be able to continue our main activity which was in fact the acceleration of start-ups the only difference is that today we have decided to extend our support within the framework of a nextidea partner program to other star tables in the region but not in addition to the feelings with which we support ourselves the start up men to boost program carried by start up morocco and its various partners should make it possible to support between and startups from seven countries of
nt Morocco the start up program leads to boost it will support in between and start up of seven countries including Morocco Algeria Tunisia Egypt Jordan Lebanon is the appearance of a support program in fact which will be spread between May and September a program on measure which aims to support the stars in fact tap on all the levers of validation and growth through individual support for transfers or antoine in fact with mainly with
s experts and mentors but also sessions in fact group and startups beneficiaries of the program to take advantage of several benefits good we were honored to have the support of tribes community of mentor of morocco from the international for all our activities which have are always in fact were present for the starter to allow them to all develop the different mentors who will enrich the start up program leads to boost by their participation display pro
different sons so today the mentors who intervene are different profiles  be they start-up founders even a serial entrepreneur  investors  business angels or or trying large companies which today go from one side to the other either their own experience in fact have this ability to be able to support in fact the start-ups or through their expertise in supporting certain not high potential the ccg will play a crucial role for the financing of start-ups low
ed in Morocco and beneficiaries of the program today in fact the ccgl a very important role in the framework of financing makes startups a Morocco gateway to trtowards the innobio jacket fund which have been partners since the launch is therefore through the innobio usa fund in fact it will allow us to be able to finance up to mg in grants to the tune of billions word honor loan is what there is a very large lever funded for early-stage startups for their per
put precisely to finance the first operations of their activities that's it ladies and gentlemen that's all for this number of tp universe but I remind you that you can find it on Tuesday every other day from p.m. on the final three masts see you very soon these resignations have you was presented by the central guarantee fund
  hello hello so you are an expert in the field of logistics and you are also an associate director within aléa a digital transformation consulting firm yes and you collaborate with the large French firm website specializing in cancer between you will not say the contrary if I affirm that the world has experienced since at least covid a total disorganization firstly of the productive apparatus on a planetary scale but also in terms of logistical organization
e with your logic of rupture of scarcity of additional costs and various problems which globally impact the entire planet so it is not a question of a regional or cyclical crisis it is a crisis which is systemic and which affects the whole planet and even Morocco cannot escape it it is suffering the full brunt of the consequences of these disorganizations  so if you had to make a global diagnosis of the trends that were set in motion during covid or perhaps you would tell me before covid and which continue
will evolve over the next few years in terms of these logistics platforms on a global scale on a scale in fact what is happening today finally I am going to talk before the war outbreak of the war in Ukraine about the second phase of the war in Ukraine because that the war in Ukraine and it began in that at the end the world went into recession the central banks tried to camouflage this with injection and monetary printing but from December we returned
ntrera session then if we follow some macroeconomic indicators we see it is easily even if it is official growth rate disguise this reality of course so the corollary of that is that we started to see the price of the container for example which began to rise the meter maritime it has started to take on quite significant proportions  a phenomenon which will accelerate when we lift the lockdowns in Europe and we start to restart so the requests br
ultimately which arises with a sudden re-acceleration our factories continue to operate with health restrictions so continue to go wrong so what we do is that we increase then you have a demand which increases and a demand for local production which goes wrong what you do compensates you with imports so we have drawn even more on an import which is unbalanced so you have the price of the container which reaches peaks we do not like to arrive at dollars the price of the co
ncontainer starting from eh so it's it's quite almost and at the same time you have then people take hold of it not necessarily much realized but there was one of the biggest logistical operations in history that is to say the operation of distribution of vaccines in the whole world which is mainly done via air because of the constraints therefore which means that you end up with chains which are broken with the availability of container or a price of the container
ur which is unaffordable and at the same time the only way you have to catch up with a maritime logistics chain which is in addition it is nothing it the air brother which has become unaffordable because very often occupied by vaccines and then they can places which remained well it was to the highest bidder and it was very very expensive so what started to give shortages on electronics on electronic components also processors all these things there was even a shortage
e for we were even looking for a laptop to buy one and we had more eh even in Morocco yes there are more and then the stocks that we listen to we are running out of stocks so indeed it creates this pphenomenon there it took a long time to get back on track and then you also have actors who have disappeared because with the lockdowns of things like that you have people who have disappeared so we had to rebuild logistics managers who were broken so it was starting to recover
e square then badaboum china is starting to have problems with the covid it is the chinese who are starting to do lockdowns especially in the shenzhen region which has one of the biggest chinese ports and one of the biggest pores in the world so you have the port of china zen on the dencon side happy with all that here are the big poles the big poles which were starting to stop and so that means that you have you have your supply chains once again which are damaged and which until now have not been
 are not necessarily recovered from what is happening especially since china continues with the ferokovite policy we understand very badly seen from the outside since at home globally we have decided to turn the page with the micron variant and in china they persist in this logic of lockdown as soon as there is a worker who has a cold well I hardly caricature concerns the whole factory if you sneeze you find yourself locked up in a camp finally it's extraordinary what happens over there in the bad s
end of the term so that does not necessarily actually help the supply of materials and products and then you have added the Russian offensive in Ukraine which has finally made Russian land in Ukraine itself has nothing to offer it is the sanctions that have been decided on the outcome of this offensive by the western world against russia quite once again came to mess up supply chains that were just recovering from the c
ovid and so it creates a whole kind of teasing game where we will move the sources of supply we will go instead of buying Russian oil we buy Chinese oil but we know that the Chinese do not produce oil but it is Russian oil but it doesn't matter we just changed the label on the barrel we had with india also with oil derivatives of russian oil which are refined by one of the much more expensive resold to europeans quite even arab
Saudi Arabia by the way by buying Russian oil by reselling to Europeans so there is a whole reconfiguration of the supply chains which continues to be done even today with platforms because the Russians must not dream if they are prohibited from certain number of goods but they always find a way to get them but it's just that it's done more directly so there you have a lot of import and export firms that are flourishing in turkey or in dubai or in certai
We have observed the evolution of freight per train between china and russia and it has never been higher than since the war with ukraine the volume china buys on behalf of russia can russia not buy directly ok then that is overall the global phenomenon after there is another phenomenon which has evolved in parallel it is inflation which is partly due to the problem of deforalisation of the supply chain of raw materials etc but which has also
 due to a totally crazy monetary policy but they lost during the covid well indeed we resorted to printing money in a frantic way and today we are also paying the price in terms of inflation at all levels in the financial markets but also at the level of raw materials yes so the inflammation is at the same time a consequence but at the same time a factor due to other elements such as monetary and inflation has started to take effect
ectively with the prices of transport which were the first drivers of inflation in my opinion so when you have the price of maritime transport you should know that world commercial traffic is by sea so if maritime freight increases everything increases everything even increases oil everything and oil is or world trade in value in terms of value this is the most traded raw material far beyond any other raw material so if you have the cost of
he transport of this raw material which necessarily increases its price increases and if it increases tout absolutely so everything is increasing so that inflation it started there monetary policies have meant that then not only monetary policies especially in europe the fact also that europe has allowed itself between two parentheses to have to proceed with referrals to have russian so as to discuss at the limit of legality or not the legality is questionable we make that euro started to pe
rder of its value people tomorrow if there is a problem exactly so what makes the euro dive so there it is recovering sir in my opinion it is only cyclical due in particular to the fact that crypto currencies are in the process of drink the cup a communicating vase effect so people get out of crypto they go on the first currency which finds so it's euro among others but but euro has chronically and will chronically suffer from this referral policy and which
who hasn't who hasn't done that good to the reputation of europe what is it when we see the underlying trend for at least a year or more it's the euro which is losing ground against the dollar yes that is to say we expect parity almost between the dollars and below not even the same option for a while before rising slightly there is no reason these trends should not resume normally that the factors at the origin have not changed no in europe the cost of the ne
rgie which has increased inflation in the industrial sector or in germany and it is close to your industry we are going to the average location for the population the price index but at the industry level it is a disaster for germany moreover they went to china recently with horse so me we can come back to that because I have my little theory on that about his on his trip to china because I think he had gone to negotiate something else but things that are di
don't feel on tv but i have to get a peace from russia no no i think maybe it's gone and moved on because if the euro continues to fall there are two countries that better get out of the euro and fast it's germany or italy so either germany comes out from above the most fragile the most solid here is either germany from above or from above saying I'm leaving before having all the cannonballs around me which will show the in the background and therefore one of the hypotheses is q
something discussed with cgping the possibility of rec either the Italians come out the bottom because because if they don't come out it flows what so that's to be seen so to come back to your question on the the problem of inflation and energy is that it should be known that the European countries before paying oil and gas to the Russian in euros it was in the contracts therefore in euros in dollars but most of the time it was done in euros and therefore what the Russians did is
 that they accepted payments in euros with their euros and bought either western corporate services or they bought european goods and the surpluses were deposited with the european central bank for an interest rate if the famous billions that were chosen by the bank central and what is happening today is that as we want more  we no longer want to have to do with Russians  we will have to get oil and gas on the markets m
worlds and there it is discussed in dollars so you will have countries of the European economic area which before did not process their energy we did not buy their energy in dollars which go towards the end of February March somewhere around there depending on how the winter will unfold the market to renew their stock of gas and oil  well above all gas and therefore they will have to buy dollars all the time with such a delivery of euros naturally which will obviously result from this
 and a dollar which should then except surprise we are never sure of anything but except surprise which should go through the roof which does not necessarily bother the united states either in terms of export competitiveness no so there is no winner in history no there is nobody who is winning finally the united states still manage to fall back on their feet because because they are the ones who supply the oil they sell them at exorbitant prices the germans willto be at gen
Oh there you know I don't know if you have been following the activity the news but there are a lot of all the energies all the companies intensive energies the processes that require a lot of energy are being tried are being exported sexiler to the united states yes in particular then now since we are talking about american women so who says it is platinum root maritime you were talking about it earlier and who says maritime route says american fleet yes then is there i know
 there has not been a change in the doctrine of approach on the American side in relation to the question of supplies by sea quite for just to put into context since the end of the Second World War it is the Americans and the American fleet in particular who ensure the security in the seas of the world and which allowed globalization  that is to say from the moment when the American navy ensured security in the seas of the world international trade via the sea
 was able to be done and was able to be done at reasonable rates because the Americans provided security you know that there is no boat leaving a port if it is not insured and therefore the fact that the United States Navy has ensured security in the sea ​​here are the premiums insurance premiums are affordable what is happening today is that americans find themselves in a situation the americans have always been a protectionist country that looks at itself not very interesting here is i
They have always been they have been forced to leave their homes to ensure their hydrocarbon supplies and so suddenly they provide the three or four major maritime groups that travel the globe which all leave from the Persian Gulf you leave from the Persian Gulf so if you go east you will go up a pacific if you are east or you will pass south of sri lanka you will pass after the strait of malacca which is entirely controlled by the states
united between indonesia and malaysia and that's what locks the chinese by the way or who locked it the chinese you arrive in china and then you arrive in japan so that's the east road the west road well it's the opposite you go up the red sea so canada then after the channel and then you go up to the north of europe and or else the road that starts from gibraltar that goes down to south america so there you have the major global maritime routes what is it
and so the Americans ensured this security there with insurance premiums as I said which were affordable and also made available the swift system comes the dollar which in fact allowed world trade instantaneous instantaneous the Americans are withdrawing because today finally they are self-sufficient in energy at least for the years to come with what is discovered today as a deposit the workforce they have a rather healthy demography the united states so there is no challenge
demographic decline there is no growth either but there is no decline which is already enormous for a developed country absolutely there is no decline they have they have mexico nearby which can possibly provide the workforce who would miss canada in the north which is one of the biggest commodity producers in the world of raw materials and others and a market which happens to be south america and then even beyond so they are more very incentive to go around the globe
with their navy and so it's a movement that started with jerusalem lebouche which was accentuated accelerated with trump and that biden did not question so completed by biden but undertaken by trump so they come back they fall back on themselves and it remains a movement that going to continue because the contributing to the american no longer really wants to take care of world affairs and fund this and therefore the fact that the american navy is withdrawing from the worlds of the navies of the seas of the world v
to create what we are actually going to go back to the th century that is to say that we are going to go back to regional units like china like japan like when we look at north africa for example it has always been morocco and egypt europe it will be played out between france and germany united kingdom and united kingdom so here we go back to a maritime space policynew geopolitics a little multicolored rather than a hypoder chain how will this result in an additional cost because you
s talk earlier about the guarantee that washington provides in terms of security which resulted in affordable costs yes so today is it this logic of withdrawal participates in an increase in costs not necessarily in terms of insurance today it is no longer the only factor that determines but I don't know in terms of not protectionism but a desire to control more effectively by the regional powers that you mentioned earlier to their
maritime space and people passing through inevitably have an impact  that is to say that you are going that's the refinement that the big drug boss who said that globalization was over there was when the war he dragged on was started he has he has he is he made an exit by declaring that the modeling was finished so already with the covid so we will return to more regionalized economies what will travel what will take a boat or a plane it will be products that have a better
eur or a bigger margin of added value than today because the cost of transport is bound to increase because before the Americans did for everyone did security for everyone today which is finally tomorrow and when I say tomorrow is years we will see how long it will take you will have to send your own navy to secure your own supply routes so inevitably a taxpayer will pay for all that so it will increase
the countries inevitably will not be able to do and so they will have to negotiate with washington which is to be paid for washington to protect me I am thinking of japan in particular a country which depends entirely on the rest of the world for these raw materials  particularly energy  since it has nothing in terms of gas oil while there is a naval fleet a self-defense army with a powerful team but which has no projection capacity to india to the sweden channel to the mediterranean alo
rs japan if if japan has a big projection capacity finally it has a big finally not as old handsome as that of the americans obviously continue at the chinese time b but they can not attack a country no unless they defend a ship this is what has been amended for the moment they cannot do it and their navy although inferior to the chinese navy the experts say that it is more potent which is the most modern here it is more modern and the best
our qualities the chinese navy is very very supplied but in boats who who don't know how to stray too far from the decorations what is it they need supplies and that's why they try to set foot in sri lanka the pearl distiller a set of military bases so so they have in burma they have sri lanka they are trying to have a foothold in the solomon islands finally here are all these things there to ensure their route because their ship is not autonomous
s they need basics regularly to be able to refuel their ship unlike the American fleet which can who can cross the nuclear world and then over protect by submarines destroyers frigates so now Morocco how does this impact Morocco globally all this disorganization in terms of head of logistics so apart from the blow what it creates imbalances of the rarities of the has it caused the Moroccan fabric to be configured or not o
n is still in that of what it is yes waiting for better days keeping the hope that it will get better so it is we will see we will see but what the first of the rarities is going to be the dollar the first of the rarities is going to be beyond because you explained earlier here you are going to have all the countries of the European area which are going to start seeking to supply themselves with energy in dollars so the dollar will become will become a currency a relatively difficult currency in this
ccess what has we will see how the americans react is what they are going to turn the money printing press you know at the same time they are in the process of raising interest rates so who says raising interest rates says after that one and then he dried up theseto say that effectively you are not renewing credit so there are fewer and fewer dollars circulating and at the same time you will have a strong demand on the dollar so what makes that is the value theoretically with
 everything is going well should go through the roof so we will have difficulty getting supplies of dollars and on the other side for morocco you have your primary market which is europe which will start to enter into a long energy crisis and which will necessarily result in of a relatively marked recession therefore less volume of exchange between the new and the import and export of the two can be completely affected and therefore for me the first difficulty for the ma
roc that's going to be the dollar that will become difficult to access so for these energy supplies he will he will suffer to have dollars and his first customer through which the currencies arrive the currency will necessarily fall everyone expects it to fall again one little to come but we don't see how for a while now he's had a little respite but actually quite and walking who's going to be who's going to be depressed so that's the first problem for the Tue
oc already before going any further on the level of these two problems there you already have the main partner who is already in economic recession it will worsen yes and the future scarcity of the dollar yes near future very near relatively so do we have to deduce that right now the central bank of morocco must reconfigure the exchange server by seeking to convert part of the stocks in euros into dollars in order to anticipate these scenarios there and at the level of the european partner
 must we look for alternative markets now to sell our production in africa we have seen both everywhere but there are already beginnings of the type I don't have the impression I agree I don't know or it's not it's not shouted from the rooftops but the two there are you have to switch back to increasing your dollar reserves of course finding alternatives to oil and gas is not fashionable at the moment laughs oh okay so Morocco also needs to prepare a subject that I understand
ds regularly on your channel it's the subject of the soap maker yes it's a subject that is finally coming back who who if you want to spend pay attention to these foreign exchange reserves it's one of the ways what it's good to do this old house again to avoid because the blow at which you buy crude and the blow you buy racing is not the same so your foreign exchange reserve does not take the same refining exploded for a year they have done what from a few dollars to
 dollars they made x or x yes precisely because of the refineries which closed during the covid in particular and so here we are  therefore  we have the energy sovereignty which passes  among other things  through the ability to refine a product oneself a crude oil than in anyone rather than to import derivatives we have foreign exchange reserves which must be strategically restructured in a forward-looking logic and we have the redeployment on other alternative markets to reduce the share
of dependence on the European Union and the recession it is already experiencing and which will then worsen apart from these major axes that others can do in Morocco in terms of  for example  when we talk about the merchant fleet of Greece finally countries like Chile etc. what about Morocco in terms of capacities in terms of very weak logistics Morocco today has a fleet  whether merchant or military  which is largely undersized both in relation to its geographical position
e and to its ambitions and so you have today in Morocco said military buildings which are capable of taking the high seas and when I say I am not talking about availability you know that each building has an availability rate you have the training needs you you have lots of lots of things that happen on a military building regardless of its type which means that if you have ten of them you have roughly projectable ones at any time so it's extremely low
morocco would only be in morocco already before talking about outside morocco inside morocco people we exploit very little very littlewater if you want to send goods from tangier to casablanca send it to you via the highway via a truck what if ultra at the limit but whereas if we used water knowing that maritime transport costs a tenth of what road transport costs and then the quantity which can transport is huge eco-friendly containers and
the romans knew that coming from the time of the romans the romans when he was in morocco they only used the sea or the rivers in any case it's that or the rivers so the smooth all that is a river there so that's why there are very little road brings back to morocco it's because the romans used water was available in morocco and so he sailed rather than building roads and i think that's a good attitude that we should resume okay so there sovereignty economy
that it is also the fact of acquiring cheap means of justice available and even in terms of the capacity to move goods already inside Morocco we are not even talking about exchanging with the rest of the world already inside Morocco then after projecting our our merchant navy of the military to ensure our trade routes mainly towards Africa after possibly towards the Mediterranean but especially towards Africa because for this question of cost the road
ier costs much more than the maritime but we can say that all the same for a few years there has been an awareness of this logic there good then at the level of the railways there is the sgv the high speed line it is the tgv but there we do for people not for goods but at the maritime level there was still the big project of your jemed which is strategically located between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic allowing it to play on both
tables and in the end was to make morocco also a platform for world trade etc and there we are currently talking about a future project for darla a huge port in dakhla to connect with the rest of the atlantic so what you are saying is that the infrastructure is good but it is not enough but you also need a projection capacity both military and commercial so that one protects the other yes after that it is expensive all that of course enormously expensive especially everything that
is maritime the training of people and then the equipment itself it is enormously expensive you know that and that it has aviation and the most expensive naval air force these are buildings that take years to build so in fact when you talk about maritime what you do today it's for the next it's for what's going to happen in years but we can say that not having them costs even more expensive of course if you have the Americans who are withdrawing as security increases.
ity of the security of the military roads finally the commercial roads you will have to do it benoît malon and therefore like any change you have two ways of approaching it either you participate you wish it quietly or back wall and you do it you do it wrong what then last question there we are on the medium long term rather the project of the Chinese of the new silk road which aimed to circumvent the American gemmonies at the oceanic level by my father the depth
 continental Eurasian where china globally is sovereign with countries rather close like kazakhstan russia etc to reach from northern europe morocco having joined the on the slope or the maritime version of the silk road there is had a partnership that was signed would the materialization of this project make it possible to solve this problem there and to reduce costs by putting the land and the sea in competition in a way not because the roads of the so
ie mainly for the Chinese to project their products and then to import I'm looking back from Europe you know a lot you countries that have a positive trade balance with China apart from Germany there was the same Germany I think that's no longer the case has been the case until so that we are trade obviously if we attract Chinese capital at the same time which will be complicated we agree in relation to what europe is doing with the russians indeed
 it's complicated but in the madnessand it could have worked that is to say merchandise on one side and ideas on the other and capital on the other it could be but finally on paper it works but I have not yet seen real physical manifestation finally in general trade with Chinese is very often in favor of Chinese in fact it is always like that otherwise and then a last alternative but still it is on paper it is the polar route which is proposed by Russia yes with nuclear icebreakers
areas which allow you to access directly here with no yes a favoring factor according to there are some who wish there are some who do not wish but even with forgiveness with the nuclear ice flanges warming or not we can make a way of course excredible as an alternative or is this just the end of Russian communication? There is already a northern road but here we are talking about the road. I am just going to open a parenthesis to explain why the Russians have an imperative need.
At the end of this road  the oil which is extracted in Si BF which supplies the port of Saint Petersburg and therefore which therefore flows towards Europe which comes from Siberia on this side is an oil which comes out of the permafrost and therefore the Russians need that this oil is constantly flowing if it stops flowing it freezes and if it freezes everything is dedicated and that's a bit for that it's for this reason that the Europeans are trying to annoy them to ensure that it blocks their export and p
or the short story is how the soviet union collapsed it was because they could no longer export their oil because of saudi arabia which had doubled their production and the whole network the whole extraction network had collapsed and it had brought it to its knees the Soviet Union which ended up collapsing so the Russians are trying to find solutions so that the oil continues to come out in small parts  that is to say solutions which will use only
e punctually and that they will stop later the economic interest is that there are pipelines which go from Siberia to the chemicals they are in the process of building them they use the railway too and a contract of billions of dollars between the two which was signed all in particular to supply China with energy and therefore they are in the process of routing pipelines from Siberia from the fields of Siberia to China that will put even with the good will of the Chinese and the
extraordinary work force of the Chinese it will take years years I don't know and so we tend to go through paths so that the oil stops flowing so one of the solutions is to go around there he also speaks of a railway which should pass through Iran and go down to India to supply one of the oils so all these are things that will be done but which will require a lot of time so it is these paths of these maritime routes which are today
I imagined on which these are temporary solutions in fact because economically it is not what is agreed in any case thank you very much for your very interesting and quite alternative insight in the way of seeing things which only enriches the debate and the exchange and I hope see you again very soon for another subject it works very very rich in perspective approach and intellectual production thank you very much thank you and I also thank all the spectators who
followed us and I'll see you next week for a new episode
  hello and welcome to economic emergency so everyone has heard in recent days about the bankruptcy of the silicon valley bank of the silvergate bank and the signature bank so this is not without reminding us of the infamous bankruptcy of the lemendrador with all the crisis which are follow-ups so today we must worry about its bankruptcies where we must read them only as sectoral bankruptcies limited to tech but to make matters worse the world is not going to
 no better  that is to say independently of bank bankruptcies and also of problems at the level of raw materials and energy materials with risks of new surges in prices at all levels and Morocco must take into account all these developments in order to integrate them into a proac policytive and anticipatory so to talk about it we have the chance to welcome if you knew hello hello so I remind you that you are a specialist and expert in intelligence
economic and supply chain ence and I open thank you for having accepted our invitation again since you are now a regular you economic agents for our happiness it is always a pleasure to debate with you I like to contradict with people with the team we discuss ideas and not of events it works I will not spare you so what is the svb the name of the other banks and there is also the credit smith here is the reason for svp is very simple when you know very b
well  the party for ten years has issued treasury bonds with negative rates or even and that since a year ago we have started to issue treasury bonds with rates higher than treasury bonds from years to years because it there was an automatic increase the old treasury banks have maturities of years years unfortunately it is that during this year there were a lot of withdrawals of money and as the banks in times of liquidity solvency have available
The only way to meet the needs of their customers is to put the old treasure banks up for sale  but since these are treasure bonds that were only at or indicative of the top of the wind  it is sales below of the nominal value which also caused an additional loss at the level of the banks now all of this is it on purpose or something I don't know we're not going to go into the pendant just so that our listeners understand because
e that everyone is not initiated to these mechanisms there so in fact we have regional size banks like the xvp rather specialized in tech since it was the bank of startups in particular financed by the capitalist who found themselves in the serenity scheme due of the policy of the buttock that you recalled a vesti enormously in treasury banks with an immaturity maturity of five years and at the time the remunerative rate was very low negative real rate but your nominal
was from to then the problem is that in the meantime the party which had promised not to touch the manager decided to increase several times we went from to I currently believe the last water was in February which means that any hospital director depreciates the value of goals so and then there are people from startups who wanted to withdraw their money because during the covid period like the startup companies at the IT level they co
nnu a bit so they wanted to invest a little more and it's added value so in addition the banks when you received this money this agent hasn't invested anything yet in the good transactions it has a snowball effect and then good all of a sudden Suddenly there are startupers who wanted to and the problem is that the sbb did not have it does not matter because it had invested in the good results so the party exactly and therefore the only way to pay them as you explained is to sell
e the treasury bonds but as we said that the tutorial director depreciates the nominal value of the bonds you trevores it is a dead loss so it caused the sheet and in the wake of fbb there is also the signature bank marseille all the small banks they have assets of billions of dollars so my question yes normally a serious bank when it invests massively in a risky way on treasury bonds hoping that the key rate does not increase and looks for when
even to protect themselves with swaps that is to say derivative products to protect themselves from fluctuating rates yes you haven't done it any idea frankly I think it has to be done I think it hasn't been done at the level of the sdp okay they agree have not been because as you have gone out of liquidity I believe that they have not realized now the real question that must be asked is that following this good group of certain small sales it is that the decision that was taken by the secret
general secretary of the treasury that he had said that all the banks that have a guarantee that all the banks that have more than billions in assets agree so the small sales and I can tell you that the party where thethe american government has been attacking the small banks since then since now the question that will arise is that everyone will find themselves hosting their property in large banks as morgan says like a bag etc. so the question is that he will not
sser it is that tomorrow the small ones will disappear there will remain a dozen or so small sales so will become a cartel here are what are already but in a clearer way through a phenomenon of concentration so I can tell you that quite simply that for ten years the biggest banks have had more than billions of dollars in additional funds now the question that is being asked is what is the connection between what is being
it happens in the united states with credit swiss indeed because credit swiss is not specialized in latex it is a traditional bank which has a very diversified client portfolio there is everything there are individuals companies actually is that just the effect of panic on the markets which meant that it was a little ahead of achille it was already fragile because we have been talking for a few years there are certain European banks such as credit suisse there deutsc
he bank the first bank the bnp general society so they are why the problem what is happening is that these banks there it is not at the level of their balance sheet of assets the real problem is the orbylan it is what is called the swap it is the guarantees this what we call care is the insurance contracts when you carpool at the table of sales reached you tassure etc as well at the level of insurance at the level and therefore first of all the bank is guaranteed and the problem c
is at the level of care care is not denominated in dollars and its inhibits in euros nor in france all swaps are denominated in dollars and it is either it is a market of more than billions of dollars and credit suisse already had billions of dollars of swap it's in dollars now the question arises the rescue of credit swiss could have been done a few years ago when you said it well as well said credit swiss it's not today that we knew that life a p
problem now the question that will arise good is that as an economics what is the reason why in my opinion me it is my personal opinion why credit swiss was torpedoed att or years what can i tell you in something push under the train tracks as well as small american banks versus big banks is that just for me the reason it is from a strategic point of view because as i can tell you as i
i told you earlier the care is in dollars so america the united states which is for me personally apart from the yen what is the currency that can compete with the dollars finally currency for french transactions but not as much as currency as someone if they want have a guarantee it is better to place them in three because they have their chance so to prevent the Swiss franc tomorrow from becoming a competitor of the dollar it was better to torpedo the Swiss franc from
to be able to guarantee a certain energy a certain guarantee of the dollar this is a personal index so the goal is to be discreet it is that you have just after the resumption of Swiss credit for ubs all of the English central banks Swiss European Japanese and American and in all guarantees the dollars now I'm going to say to myself that besides all that for what they are has the united states not militarized and materialized the dollar at the level of European need it is to d
angry that behind all that that through this attack the Americans will be able to impose a certain in quotation marks if we can go further their policy at the level of the Ukraine Russia war at the level of energy at the European level when you also know very well the the united states have just launched since the end of the inflation reason act that is to say that it subsidies all the companies which will come to settle in the united states within the framework and now the question which arises as to what f
there will not be a transfer of European industry to relocation becausethe factories that are at the european level are closer to the american chinese economic model therefore automatically like the united states also needs an economic industrial power to thwart a little the chinese economic power with their innocent power which has it is to call on any industry to strong European added value to settle in the
united states through there i can tell you outright in the years europe will become an industrial desert france this is already the case with other countries so this is the reason why this game was in my opinion this game was played is to guarantee hegemony or supremacy of the dollar in international transactions just to be taken in the analysis we cannot say what its beauty has been because we will have to provide proof but we can say that it has been indirectly sabotaged by not being
s saved in the global visions that is to say that of the discredit of a Swiss banking system which had already started well before with the extension of the American legal system access etc and today it is a bit of a blow that will bring this credibility there more and more than the sequel began relatively to come out of end neutrality especially in relation to the conflict it's a cream etc so now let's stay in the dollars recently during the visit of china to moscow vladimir pou
tine announced that from now on Russian exchanges are done in ruble and yuan and that the yoann is promised a glorious future as a new currency of exchange for raw materials and there it becomes it becomes sensitive so to be a danger for the dollar I put no or be a little too early for what you are doing it is a beginning the beginning of an end or the beginning of a beginning why i am going to explain exactly the problem what happens is that the moment when we did we banned russ
ie to sell its oil or its gas in dollars by withdrawing from the swift first and to be able and to limit the price of a barrel of oil to dollars for the Russians the problem what happened there was there was a reverse action  namely the group appreciated against the euro and the dollar they lost the dollar and the euro lost French natively against the group so automatically when the Russians start to sell oil in rubles like recruits
er very expensive so this income to what the oil the barrel of oil becomes even more expensive so I think it crosses this meeting which has recently had the last three days only after if among the Russians it is simply to allow themselves to sell Russian oil through what will still allow to lower the price of the barrel even more because the fast is less valued than barrels at the level of Asia and at the level of certain African countries like the well said poutine
okay so at this moment the question is in the works and this is also perhaps the reason why saudi arabia is picking up from china because the problem that is going to happen now is that since the interest rates have increased we know very well that at the level trading companies they make land so they need credit bank overdrafts and calls counted at the level of raw materials will cost more and more since the rate has increased therefore automatic
only without there being any attack on the flow of raw materials automatically prices will increase that I did not fit into the framework of what will happen given the tensions between oil prices at the Russian level even cheaper than other countries and at the level of the opera which will have certain countries which will not want to sell etc etc etc maybe tomorrow in two months in three months four months and perhaps there will be the same oil shortages because we will have more
cord is also a game that can be played so the question that is being asked here is that and all the more so since the Russians have been withdrawn from the swift and as they are no longer in the rata of the tallow the westerners can no longer follow at control what is happening at the Russian level yes because before Western intelligence had access finally there was total traceability of what happened between the Russians and the Chinese that cannot be controlled so that is whynow at
level of the chinese the russians will use as a springboard to be able to sell even more and have the same placing on the markets for raw materials moreover this is already somewhat the case with india we have seen how products derived from petroleum products derived from europe while it was made from oil and for dinner for refining i just read lately my name is drunk i have had so many other things is that either there has been a decrease in at many refineries that
and an increase in or in world oil production so you automatically notice a gap from to lack so when we say I allow myself to say when we say we don't need the samir mathematically it's not proven at this time bankruptcies during the covid by the fact of what type of oil we are using etc now and then knowing that the Germans they asked themselves to delay the sale of the stop of fossil cars
 for so there is a whole guy there is a whole paradigm that is changing so the question of the samir between what I am saying mathé we are not justified there has never been so much strategy today to rehabilitate finally to reactivate the family and make it a strategic position so now concerning Morocco then concerning energy you have started to address what the risks were in particular and an increase in the price of oil and energy products
riveted on oil in the meantime what are we going to do what we have what it's not the first time a few words ago we had already experienced another dazzling in time took the and made up of air hydrocarbons or not but also compared to others shutters of other energy materials what should morocco expect you return the next few months of the next few months there will be a huge change especially firstly there will be an increase in the prices of raw materials at least
by the interest rate increase note that you're talking about all european party interest everyone has increased rates so at the level when you're trading term hedging or or bank overdraft because you're trading it at that's not when you trade on the barometer everything is conditioned then automatically the commodities will increase all the commodities then now the other question that is being asked when there is
 certain raw materials which will start to be sold in these raw materials more and more competitive compared to the front of other raw materials with other currencies with the dollar so at that time there will be an effect on the level of the flow of quantity of materials raw materials because everyone will fight to buy the raw material from the cheapest one than from the others so automatically there will be a bottleneck somewhere and it will take even more to
increase the prices of raw materials now for me for Morocco I'm going to say I'm starting from what has just happened in recent days there is the economic model of the strategy on which we are starting by port in a lollipop for me now it has become essential and important that over the five years in the coming April by the end of this government mandate  Morocco must be in orbit in relation to the new cake  so the cake as t
el rachid everyone everyone agrees immediately let me explain the cake currently the world country is billions to billions of dollars in it will be at billions of dollars and on these and billions these are resources these are information of resources these are sources of the world bank of the imf it is not me who says it and on these millions billion dollars you have these gdp will come to read and the industry so if we take millions it makes you in the billions of dol
lars billions of dollars it's a trillion dollars compared to the billions currently it's almost half of the current country that will change the structure of the countries now with what is happening more what is happening currently in in paradise currencies that will use and location so morocco for me pPersonally he must be he must be orbiting this new cake in these four years five years of the stra
very economic development team of the structure so over these four five years so that they put them into orbit so that they can then participate in having a share of this new cake because if we don't take this part of this no cake I guarantee you in the years to come it's the desert and I apologize it's not self-esteem for this spade I'm in the process it's not for so for me currently it makes me think a little about the strategy firstly for me the energy problem
genetics must be resolved by the end of the year by September at the latest  especially for the family problem if there is goodwill and we want to solve the problem of this because without energy inflation we will go towards hyperinflation all the more that even if it is reactivated now in the immediate future  in fact the use that can be made of it is a storage site  on the other hand the refining capacities that it will be necessary to invest to put a level it will take some time we will do it d
okay so first of all there is that there is indeed why because if we don't get started there is the whole country's budgetary policy will be off the mark especially at the level of the trade balance because that is the real problem we have absolutely it's so much to buy also very well to say you explain better than me for me the trade balance is the sinews of war so if we don't solve this problem and at least minutes from the trade balance problems e
t in addition if we can add a little renewable energy for me at least to be able as I say very often to reduce the trade balance deficit we will be next to the plate and even at the level to attract industry we will arrive no we will have a bubble currently which tomorrow will disappear so I am saying if it put rachid to tell the government it reminds a little of the national football team we have noticed that the national team when
we were in the world championship we had a good general we had good fighters the general put in place a good tactic and I don't rhyme see what I liked with yassine job during the second match he put aside his organ and his pride he withdrew completely because he hadn't mortgaged the team so I say to the government it's time for strategy there is not only at the public level but at the private level as well he will express and there I
I want to say one thing I'm going to use a saying that I have a lot from uncle here when he talks about productivity actually this gap as on which we can attack is to set up productivity and there I want to draw attention a little if you allow us to open a debate at the national level for the moment for me currently read it is just a means of collecting taxes but not to put in place an industrial strategy for the country for me I am instead of putting d
e read I do not think there is no tax on the bond but on the other hand there will be a tax on the dividends which have a direct distribution as at the level of reading there will be no tax on the companies on the other hand during a certain period on the four rings that we just talked about it i would have preferred that at the level of each activity especially the activities for which morocco would like to position itself to set up a tax on the gross operating surplus i will therefore explain to myself each activity whatsoever
if by the way I have plastic metallurgy etc there is an economic model and me I prefer the surplus why so if you exploitation it is that what we have to be positioned in relation to global competition it is as if therefore for this fact we will have put in place here for get out of the activity here is the operating surplus in which we must explain what the gross operating surplus means it is after having paid all the charges yes external the purchases so what is the p
personnel etc so the salaries so what is left is the depreciation plus the others plus the depreciation and the results of the company which will allow me to see what I do not have and that it can also be to compare myself with the refeential worldwide that I explain that differently imagine that you are a private school you have some indicators no conflict between teachers students parents of students not satisfied with succeeding students and a whole mail direct
ur with his little tablet who sees a student in the yard jumping for joy and who says to himself but what is it who ah it's after two that's why he's happy he's calling you can share this joy with us sir I passed my year ah good ah yes yes you have how many averages sir I have on I told him before following it's good but say yes sir it's two points more than the average and there he takes his tablet he opens he sees in the history class that everything has
 suddenly he noticed after you know that it's the last language of the class it's not because you compare yourself to tax everything that is above will start paying taxes because you're somewhere you don't measure up element on the other hand everything that will be below will be entitled to subsidies in order to be able to reach a level of global competitiveness okay that's the reason why I am saying jubilation they will blow it up at the expense of a tax compared to
the b okay so in fact we should no longer think of taxation only as a factor of skills but this is true but the strategic tax children which is for the moment right to be the case we still have a way of accounting that's why I say very often that europe especially of a minister of trade and industry is not to be happy to go and make factory openings etc but to set up a strategy on which to guarantee in years of industrial exploitation and this ex
industrial exploitation it will automatically guarantee the revenue for the state if you do not guarantee an economic fabric over years or have companies that will only pass in years thereafter fall into bankruptcy but it is the state at the level of revenue that will put itself who is going to be attacked so that's it that's what I understood is that economic sovereignty that is to say that makes it possible to depend less on external shock fluctuations etc is not a closure and another
arcie but it is on the contrary it is to rethink oneself intelligently inside the world of interdependents in the different schemes etc and to think of one's future place but what is nevertheless already to understand changes of interest currently and by which paradigm when you are in talking i thought an image you said to yourself after work i play chess and now i want to tell everyone instead of playing bingo we are starting to play chess
if i take this opportunity to thank you if ossama it's always a pleasure to come and see it's i thank you very much and i hope to see you again very soon with great pleasure and i also thank all the people who followed us and as usual i'll give you an appointment next week for a new episode

so how is this possible with all the natural wealth of the country this is what we are going to break down together in this press review taken from an analysis published on final zouari president of the center for studies and reflection on the francophone world algeria becomes the least rich country in the maghreb the article by yes soiri president of the crmf explores the current economic situation of algeria which has become the least wealthy country in the maghreb in terms of gdp per capita according to data
 from the world bank the gdp per capita of algeria and dollars against dollars for tunisia and dollarsfor Morocco this despite the natural wealth of Algeria  particularly in hydrocarbons  the author attributes this situation to a series of ineffective economic policies since the independence of Algeria  emphasizing the lack of diversification of the Algerian economy which remains highly dependent on hydrocarbons representing approximately national exports in comparison
n Morocco and Tunisia have succeeded in diversifying their economies in particular thanks to a framework favorable to national and international investments and the establishment of numerous industrial sectors the ranking of the African Development Bank bad of November positions Morocco and Tunisia respectively in second and fourth place among the countries of the continent in terms of industrialization while Algeria is in the th position. Moreover  Algeria demonstrates a certain i

 indebted the country's low level of economic diversification and the continued decline in global demand for hydrocarbons could worsen the situation  moreover the global supply of hydrocarbons increases with the appearance of new producers which contributes to the fall in prices despite some attempts at diversification Algeria could see its foreign exchange reserves continue to decline at a rate of several billion dollars per year if the current trend persists  Algeria could

so in summary for the year that has just passed in Morocco the industry is developing very well tourism has picked up spectacularly unemployment has been falling continuously for two years there is inflation but Morocco is doing quite well compared to other countries so does that mean that everything is going well in the Moroccan economy and unfortunately not quite as you know there is always something that comes to spoil the party and in Morocco the black beast of the economy is he the p
oil and more generally it is fossil fuels the country has made feats to reach a record level of exports but on the other hand it is greatly slowed down by an energy bill on import which is also unfortunately a record in for the first time Morocco has exceeded the mark of billions of dollars of imports on fossil fuels mainly because of the prices of oil  gas and coal which have skyrocketed
